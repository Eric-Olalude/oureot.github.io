Hi, and welcome to the blockchain nano degree course.

00:00:03.195 --> 00:00:08.415
We're going to pick up here at the topic of smart contract upgradability.

00:00:08.415 --> 00:00:12.120
Within this topic, we're going to discuss upgrade scenarios.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.555
We're going to also discuss solutions.

00:00:15.555 --> 00:00:19.305
We're going to discuss how we can separate data and app logic,

00:00:19.305 --> 00:00:21.450
and then security between contracts.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.300
Now, one of the questions that probably comes to

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.795
your mind is why do smart contracts need to be upgraded?

00:00:27.795 --> 00:00:32.025
Also, if the blockchain is supposed to be immutable,

00:00:32.025 --> 00:00:35.085
why even have this possibility?

00:00:35.085 --> 00:00:38.075
Well, that's exactly why we want to go through

00:00:38.075 --> 00:00:40.160
the different scenarios that

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.045
require a blockchain smart contract to be upgraded. So let's start with that.

00:00:44.045 --> 00:00:47.195
One of the things that you want to consider is

00:00:47.195 --> 00:00:50.495
a potential bug is discovered in your contract code.

00:00:50.495 --> 00:00:53.375
What happens if that contract is out there

00:00:53.375 --> 00:00:56.405
and that bug continues to be present and exploited?

00:00:56.405 --> 00:01:00.365
That's a scenario you do not want and you want to upgrade your smart contract for that.

00:01:00.365 --> 00:01:02.405
Business rules change all the time.

00:01:02.405 --> 00:01:05.450
What if your business has a different set of

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.510
parameters that it needs to use for the smart contract?

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:09.695
You would need to change that.

00:01:09.695 --> 00:01:12.710
In fact, in one of the exercises we are going to do in this course,

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.770
that's exactly the scenario we'll tackle,

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.600
where a business rule has to be changed.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.280
Another potential scenario could be where

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.285
the contract admin's private key is lost or compromised.

00:01:23.285 --> 00:01:27.515
What this does is introduce the risk of financial loss or

00:01:27.515 --> 00:01:32.345
privacy if data loss would be present due to that.

00:01:32.345 --> 00:01:37.910
Another reason why you would want to upgrade is gas prices have increased

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:43.490
and code that was fine before perhaps hits up against a block gas limit,

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.745
or it needs to be optimized to lower the overall cost.

00:01:46.745 --> 00:01:49.280
So there is a lot of different scenarios where you would want

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.025
to upgrade your smart contract.

00:01:52.025 --> 00:01:56.105
It's very important that as you think about developing your smart contract,

00:01:56.105 --> 00:01:58.625
that you build in into the architecture,

00:01:58.625 --> 00:02:00.185
this level of modularity,

00:02:00.185 --> 00:02:03.620
so that in the future if problems arise,

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.890
you can easily react to them and easily change things.
