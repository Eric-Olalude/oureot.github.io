00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
So, summary for our lesson.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.244
We started off by understanding scenarios in which Smart Contracts need to be upgraded.

00:00:09.244 --> 00:00:11.364
We discussed in particular,

00:00:11.365 --> 00:00:15.164
scenarios where there's a bug or there's a change in

00:00:15.164 --> 00:00:19.934
business rules that require contracts to be upgraded.

00:00:19.934 --> 00:00:24.329
The architecture and the techniques we've learned in this lesson help

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:29.309
us deal with those kind of scenarios in a reasonably efficient manner.

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:32.024
We also reviewed the pros and cons of

00:00:32.024 --> 00:00:35.429
different solutions for handling Smart Contract upgrades.

00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:38.219
The solution that we've discussed in this lesson

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.199
involved separating data and application logic,

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.710
but there's also the ability to have proxy contracts,

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.200
there's also the ability to migrate data,

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.060
and you'll have to evaluate and weigh the specific situation you're in,

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.775
and make a decision based on that.

00:00:55.774 --> 00:00:59.314
Finally, we actually looked through the code.

00:00:59.314 --> 00:01:06.134
We worked through exercises to implement separation of Data and Application contracts,

00:01:06.135 --> 00:01:10.519
and we also learned how we can secure the Data Contract,

00:01:10.519 --> 00:01:15.630
so only authorized Application Contracts can call into it.
