00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.229
Before starting to program supply chains using smart contracts,

00:00:04.229 --> 00:00:06.629
it's important to understand a little bit about what

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.644
supply chains and supply chain management even are.

00:00:09.644 --> 00:00:14.399
What's their purpose? How does improving a supply chain help improve a business?

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.955
Knowing this will help you understand the solutions you'll be building.

00:00:17.954 --> 00:00:20.789
In this video, we'll go over some of the basics behind

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.844
supply chain management and discuss some simple examples of how supply chain operates.

00:00:25.844 --> 00:00:28.559
Supply chain management is a broad topic

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:31.664
ranging across many aspects of almost all businesses.

00:00:31.664 --> 00:00:34.534
It includes everything needed to plan, build,

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:37.714
create, manufacture, and deliver a product.

00:00:37.715 --> 00:00:42.120
The supply chain includes everything it takes to get the product a company creates,

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:44.000
from its original materials to

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.600
its final product and all the way through the sales process.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.630
The goal of supply chain management is to take all of

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.630
this and make it as streamlined and efficient as possible.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.090
By effectively managing the supply chain,

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.510
companies are able to create more efficient solutions for their customers,

00:00:59.509 --> 00:01:02.254
raise their profits, and lower their costs.

00:01:02.255 --> 00:01:06.019
Establishing an effective supply chain takes strong leadership.

00:01:06.019 --> 00:01:08.375
On top of that, it takes a ton of tools,

00:01:08.375 --> 00:01:12.444
methods and innovations to help companies stay ahead of their competition.

00:01:12.444 --> 00:01:15.329
Simple supply chains will include a company,

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:17.510
the suppliers that it gets its material from,

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.555
and all of the customers they sell their product to.

00:01:20.555 --> 00:01:23.240
While these fundamental stay about the same,

00:01:23.239 --> 00:01:26.254
the supply chain can easily get much more complicated.

00:01:26.254 --> 00:01:28.530
It can include many more suppliers,

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.924
different types of customers,

00:01:29.924 --> 00:01:31.905
and entirely new products.

00:01:31.905 --> 00:01:35.450
As an example, let's follow the path of a coffee bean as it

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.250
makes its way from the farmer all the way to your morning cup of coffee.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.620
Your average coffee bean will go through a few stages.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.870
To name just a few of them, there's growing,

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.215
harvesting, packing, shipping, and roasting.

00:01:48.215 --> 00:01:50.900
Almost every step along the way involves

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.080
a different supplier to help push it to the next stage of its journey.

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:55.789
In this simple example,

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.520
even if there were just a single supplier for each stage,

00:01:58.519 --> 00:02:00.920
we'd have five companies involved each making

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.930
transactions as they distribute this coffee to retailers around the world.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.370
Each new retailer adds a whole new level of

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.835
negotiations and interactions that need to be handled effectively.

00:02:10.835 --> 00:02:12.439
As you can see already,

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:16.159
this can be an enormous complicated mess that can be difficult to deal with.

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:18.784
As blockchain developers, we care about this

00:02:18.784 --> 00:02:21.349
because at the core of every one of these transactions,

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:22.819
there are two main things.

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.509
There's either need to establish trust between the companies involved

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:30.774
or there's a need to automate some type of negotiation between these companies.

00:02:30.775 --> 00:02:34.295
Both of these things can be done by creating an open and shared ledger

00:02:34.294 --> 00:02:37.939
that allows these companies to collaborate and interact more effectively.

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:41.375
Lucky for us, that's exactly what the blockchain provides.

00:02:41.375 --> 00:02:43.969
This extends well beyond coffee beans to

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:46.594
anything you can think of from music distribution,

00:02:46.594 --> 00:02:49.069
to insurance claims, to car manufacturing.

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.169
The list is almost endless.

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:54.649
As you can see, the blockchain can make a huge impact if we

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.219
can figure out ways to use smart contracts to improve supply chains.

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:02.840
Coming up, we'll look a little closer at how smart contracts fit into this process.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.030
From there, you'll be in a good position to

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.310
start programming some of these solutions for yourself.
