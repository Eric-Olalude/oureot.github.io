00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.690
Congratulations!

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:04.290
You created your own private blockchain.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.794
As you notice, it's pretty simple.

00:00:06.794 --> 00:00:12.405
We have a blockchain that stores blocks linked together in a chain as a dataset.

00:00:12.404 --> 00:00:16.004
Some additional options you might want to consider to improve

00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:21.704
your private blockchain would be the addition of a peer-to-peer consensus algorithm.

00:00:21.704 --> 00:00:24.964
To recap, we just compared the difference between

00:00:24.964 --> 00:00:27.960
private and public blockchains and ways to

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.603
communicate between blockchains utilizing hashes.

00:00:31.603 --> 00:00:34.079
We continue the journey with the creation of

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.939
our own simple private blockchain without the difficulties of consensus.
