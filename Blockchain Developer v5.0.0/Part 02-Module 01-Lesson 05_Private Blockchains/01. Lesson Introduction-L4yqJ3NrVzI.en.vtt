00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.909
Hi, I'm Brandy.

00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:04.500
You're doing a wonderful job in the program.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.669
I would like to welcome you to the next lesson regarding private blockchain.

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:11.400
In this lesson, we will discuss usage of

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.320
a private and public blockchain and how to interact between the two chains.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.109
By the end of this lesson,

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:21.369
we will demonstrate building our own private blockchain ledger.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.550
We will utilize JavaScript and make use of

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.894
third-party libraries with proven methods to support cryptographic functions.

00:00:27.894 --> 00:00:29.519
To help you get started, would put

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.085
a few more details about this lesson down below the video.

00:00:33.085 --> 00:00:36.530
If you like, take some time to read through and when you're ready,

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.259
we'll see you in the next lesson on private blockchains.
