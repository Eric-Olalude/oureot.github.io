00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.375
Hello, and welcome to the blockchain nano degree course.

00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:05.009
My name is Nicol Yani,

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.080
and I'll be your instructor for this session.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.810
The focus of our course is best practices for real-world smart contract development,

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.115
with an emphasis on security and upgradability.

00:00:17.114 --> 00:00:20.729
Let's take a look at the topics we'll cover in this course.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.425
We'll start off with the topic of controlling smart contract operations.

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:27.570
This is important because in the real world,

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.240
if you have a smart contract which has a problem,

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:34.259
you'll want to be able to pause it or restart it.

00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:38.804
We also will next cover the topic of multi-party consensus.

00:00:38.804 --> 00:00:42.274
You might know this as multi-sig or multi-signature.

00:00:42.274 --> 00:00:48.695
Next, we'll focus on receiving and transferring funds through your smart contract.

00:00:48.695 --> 00:00:52.765
Then a very important topic, Smart Contract Upgradability.

00:00:52.765 --> 00:00:54.615
Since blockchains are immutable,

00:00:54.615 --> 00:00:56.929
this particular topic is of interest to

00:00:56.929 --> 00:00:59.899
any developer because if you have a bug in a smart contract,

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:01.519
you want to know how to fix it.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.060
Our next topic is data from oracles.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.019
Oracles are external data sources that can provide information to

00:01:09.019 --> 00:01:14.914
your smart contract which is a very regular event in real-world applications.

00:01:14.915 --> 00:01:18.790
Next topic would be to create a DAP,

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.900
a Decentralized Application and we'll review the user interface and in particular,

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.344
how it can respond to events.

00:01:26.344 --> 00:01:30.454
Finally, we'll discuss the Flight Shorty Project.

00:01:30.454 --> 00:01:33.500
So that's the project that is going to take all the skills that you will

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.790
acquire in this course and put them together into a project.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.930
The essence of that project is flight insurance for passengers.
