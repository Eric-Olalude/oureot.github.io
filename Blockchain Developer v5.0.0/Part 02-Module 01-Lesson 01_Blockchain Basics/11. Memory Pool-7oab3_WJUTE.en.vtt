00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.645
On any given network,

00:00:01.645 --> 00:00:04.880
transactions are happening as quickly as people decide to make them.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.140
But that doesn't mean that the network is able to

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.435
keep up with processing all of them at once.

00:00:09.435 --> 00:00:11.550
As the number of transactions being made

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.520
exceeds the number of transactions the network can process,

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.080
a waiting line builds up.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.650
This waiting line is known as a memory pool.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.625
Now, in this video we'll take a look at the details of the memory pool.

00:00:22.625 --> 00:00:26.280
The memory pool also known as the mempool is the waiting place

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.015
for all unconfirmed transactions before they are added to the blockchain.

00:00:30.015 --> 00:00:32.520
The name comes from the fact that transactions sit in

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.385
RAM memory of all the nodes in the Bitcoin network. So, what does this mean?

00:00:37.385 --> 00:00:39.300
Well, when you start making transactions on

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.540
the blockchain you'll notice that it doesn't happen instantly.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.490
This is because for a transaction to be

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.230
complete it needs to be confirmed or verified by the network.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.145
Now, this confirmation is done by specialized nodes in the Bitcoin network called miners.

00:00:53.145 --> 00:00:56.219
By validating transactions before they are added to the blockchain,

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.750
miners help ensure consensus on the blockchain.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.925
We'll focus on the details of mining and miners later in this lesson.

00:01:02.925 --> 00:01:05.960
Since there are so many transactions happening,

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.230
not everything can get picked up immediately.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.465
Transactions need to wait in line before they get validated.

00:01:11.465 --> 00:01:14.240
This line or storage space where these transactions

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.905
wait is what's known as the memory pool or mempool for short.

00:01:17.905 --> 00:01:20.600
Now to better help us visualize the memory pool,

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.735
let's jump over to blockchain.info.

00:01:23.735 --> 00:01:25.580
So, this company offers

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.065
an online Bitcoin block export service and cryptocurrency wallets.

00:01:30.065 --> 00:01:33.410
In addition, they offer amazing free online charts,

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.430
they allow anyone to learn more about Bitcoin stats and market information.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.050
Let's take a look at their unconfirmed transactions view.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.345
Now, at the time of this recording there's about 7,900

00:01:49.345 --> 00:01:53.845
unconfirmed transactions all waiting patiently to be added to the blockchain.

00:01:53.845 --> 00:01:56.000
Can you guess where they're waiting?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.855
Well, if you answered in the memory pool, that's absolutely correct.

00:01:59.855 --> 00:02:02.560
So, let's roll down a little bit and we'll see

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.780
a live feed of all the live transactions going on.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.390
Now, each transaction is uniquely identified by a hash.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.695
If you can catch one of these numbers before they file on biome,

00:02:15.695 --> 00:02:18.385
you'll see that this is a string of characters,

00:02:18.385 --> 00:02:20.560
this one here in the darker line,

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.665
that's the transaction hash.

00:02:22.665 --> 00:02:25.240
The numbers down below it in the lines with

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.735
the green arrow are the Bitcoin wallet addresses.

00:02:28.735 --> 00:02:33.340
So, a wallet address is like an email address for Bitcoin.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.365
It's a way for you to tell people where to send money when you're using a wallet.

00:02:38.365 --> 00:02:42.160
We'll go in more depth about wallets later on.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.420
In that same line, we can see information about the time,

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.340
date, and the amount that was transacted.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.070
So, it's all pretty confirmation, right?

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.975
Now, if you're interested in checking out more details about the memory pool,

00:02:54.975 --> 00:02:57.155
let's head over to the chart section.

00:02:57.155 --> 00:03:02.095
So to get there, let's scroll down and navigate to "Products",

00:03:02.095 --> 00:03:05.715
"Charts", and then in charts,

00:03:05.715 --> 00:03:08.350
let's head over to "Network activity."

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.095
In this section there are a couple of useful charts.

00:03:12.095 --> 00:03:14.215
Here we see one about the data,

00:03:14.215 --> 00:03:17.485
about the number of transactions in the memory pool at different times,

00:03:17.485 --> 00:03:20.070
the rate at which the mempool is growing,

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.020
and here one about the size of transactions waiting to be confirmed.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.550
So, I recommend you take some time to explore and look through some of these charts.

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.780
So earlier, we discussed the transactions leave

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.050
the memory pool when a miner has added them to a block.

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.140
So, miners validate the transactions before they are

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.230
added to the block and that block is added to the blockchain.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.335
This process ensures security and validation on the blockchain.

00:03:45.335 --> 00:03:49.815
So, now we know how a transaction can leave a memory pool to join the blockchain.

00:03:49.815 --> 00:03:54.670
However, this isn't the only reason a transaction might leave the memory pool.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.085
Let's actually take a quick pause to explore

00:03:57.085 --> 00:03:59.580
some other reasons a transaction could leave the memory pool.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.680
So, in the following quiz try to

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.980
decide which are valid reasons a transaction would leave the memory pool?

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.285
Don't worry if this question is a bit challenging, it's meant to be.

00:04:10.285 --> 00:04:14.065
Especially since we're asking you about a topic you haven't learned yet.

00:04:14.065 --> 00:04:18.680
So, this exercise is meant to get you thinking about how the memory pool works.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.670
So, give it your best shot and we'll discuss your thoughts afterwards.
