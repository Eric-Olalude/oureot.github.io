Congratulations on getting through my lesson.

00:00:03.805 --> 00:00:07.019
We've covered a lot of materials so far and you've come a

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:10.500
long way towards understanding the basic concepts that make up the blockchain.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.160
We put a quick recap of the topics we introduced down below the video.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.599
In the next lesson,

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.750
we'll integrate these core concepts together to begin

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.240
building and working with blockchain transactions.
