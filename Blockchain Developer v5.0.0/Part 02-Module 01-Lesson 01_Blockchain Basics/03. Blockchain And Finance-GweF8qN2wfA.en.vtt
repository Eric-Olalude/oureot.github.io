00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.140
Hopefully, you had a chance to think about the problem for a little.

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.429
It will be interesting to see if your ideas are

00:00:05.429 --> 00:00:08.359
similar to the ideas that a blockchain has come up with.

00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:10.379
Like we mentioned, the blockchain views

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.185
the financial system as something that can improve.

00:00:13.185 --> 00:00:17.445
It started off by trying to replace the banks as a trusted third party.

00:00:17.445 --> 00:00:18.960
Whether it's working or not,

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.525
is something we're still finding out.

00:00:20.524 --> 00:00:23.684
What we do know, is that it's come up with some amazing solutions

00:00:23.684 --> 00:00:27.539
to a few of the problems that it's trying to solve. So here we go.

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.059
First, banks having all this information is crucial,

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:35.170
but is it ideal for banks to have complete control over all this data?

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.240
They have access to everything we do with

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.465
our money and can choose whether or not they want to share it with us.

00:00:40.465 --> 00:00:43.945
Maybe it's better if everyone had access to these records.

00:00:43.945 --> 00:00:45.365
Instead of having a ledger,

00:00:45.365 --> 00:00:46.815
maintained by the bank,

00:00:46.814 --> 00:00:50.189
we could create a shared ledger that everyone has access to.

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:51.399
If this were possible,

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:54.570
it would allow everyone complete control over their information.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.460
Is there a way we could use the shared ledger to establish

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.670
the same level of security and trust that the banks provide?

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.010
Here's another problem that we might be able to solve.

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:05.759
Right now, if you want to send money to someone else,

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.765
banks often aren't the only third parties that handle it.

00:01:08.765 --> 00:01:11.995
Whether you use a credit card, PayPal, or Venmo,

00:01:11.995 --> 00:01:14.475
Snapcash or any other way to send money,

00:01:14.474 --> 00:01:16.769
you're giving your information to them too.

00:01:16.769 --> 00:01:21.144
Now they need to communicate with the banks and they're also handling your money.

00:01:21.144 --> 00:01:23.579
This list of companies grows pretty quickly

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:26.094
as you try to do more complicated transactions.

00:01:26.094 --> 00:01:28.829
This can result in delayed transaction times

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.164
and fees that are collected by the company's handling your money.

00:01:32.165 --> 00:01:34.990
The blockchain is trying to fix this too.

00:01:34.989 --> 00:01:37.015
By creating a shared ledger,

00:01:37.015 --> 00:01:40.424
the blockchain makes it possible to bypass these third parties.

00:01:40.424 --> 00:01:43.259
This allows you to send money more quickly and can cut

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.170
down on the fees associated with making a transaction.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.950
So those are some of the problems the blockchain is trying to help solve.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.000
You may have had different ideas and that's fine too.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.484
They can adopt being things we cover later on

00:01:55.484 --> 00:01:58.579
or maybe there's some problems that you'll be the first to solve.

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:00.929
One thing to note, is that we don't know yet for

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.510
sure whether or not this will actually work,

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.950
but there's been some amazing progress so far.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.390
I'm mentioning that because it's important to know that this is all a work in progress.

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:12.989
It's not like the blockchain is perfectly figured

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.185
out as a solution that we're just waiting for everyone to adopt.

00:02:16.185 --> 00:02:19.979
Its ideas are still being built, tested and improved.

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:23.894
What's amazing to me is the opportunity we have to be a part of the solution.

00:02:23.895 --> 00:02:27.540
So hopefully now you have a better idea of the problem the blockchain is trying to

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:31.739
solve and some of the core ideas they've implemented to try and help solve them.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.125
Keep this in mind as we move on to more complicated topics.

00:02:35.125 --> 00:02:37.710
It really helps to keep things organized in your head to

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.050
reflect on how they contribute to building the solutions.
