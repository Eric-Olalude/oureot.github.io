00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.004
The blockchain got started with it's

00:00:02.004 --> 00:00:06.365
first implementation using a new type of currency known as Bitcoin.

00:00:06.365 --> 00:00:09.960
Bitcoin is a type of digital currency that utilizes

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.595
the blockchain to help facilitate financial transactions.

00:00:13.595 --> 00:00:18.155
It laid the foundation for many other ideas underlying other blockchains.

00:00:18.155 --> 00:00:21.300
Understanding how Bitcoin works is enormous step

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.844
towards understanding ideas that span across all industries.

00:00:24.844 --> 00:00:27.890
Because of that, we'll focus a lot on Bitcoin.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.615
In this section, we'll discuss the history,

00:00:30.614 --> 00:00:32.039
and development of Bitcoin,

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:35.049
and how it helped develop these core ideas.

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:40.500
To start, Bitcoin uses the idea of blocks to group and validate transactions.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.189
A block is a group of transactions bundled together.

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:46.409
This idea is extremely important,

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:49.844
but Bitcoin isn't actually the first time we've heard of it.

00:00:49.844 --> 00:00:52.094
The idea to group, validate,

00:00:52.094 --> 00:00:55.655
and linked documents actually dates back to around 1991.

00:00:55.655 --> 00:01:00.094
This was the year that Haber and Stornetta released their research paper titled,

00:01:00.094 --> 00:01:02.324
"How to Time-Stamp a Digital Document."

00:01:02.325 --> 00:01:07.515
In this paper, Haber and stornetta imagined a new way to verify documents.

00:01:07.515 --> 00:01:12.094
They proposed time-stamping of documents and linking them to the previous document.

00:01:12.094 --> 00:01:17.094
They explained how this could form a chain of validated up-to-date documents.

00:01:17.094 --> 00:01:22.135
What Haber and stornetta proposed then would become the precursor to the blockchain now.

00:01:22.135 --> 00:01:23.969
Fast forward to 2008,

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:28.655
when an unidentified author by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto published a Whitepaper.

00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:30.989
This paper titled Bitcoin,

00:01:30.989 --> 00:01:35.929
a peer-to-peer electronic cash system laid the foundation for Bitcoin as we know it now.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.960
It completely changed how we view and understand currency.

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:41.875
On January third 2009,

00:01:41.875 --> 00:01:44.245
Nakamoto released the Bitcoin software.

00:01:44.245 --> 00:01:47.204
Unleashing the first Bitcoins into the world.

00:01:47.204 --> 00:01:51.468
Reviewing this paper will give you a strong foundation in Bitcoin,

00:01:51.468 --> 00:01:54.099
blockchain, and other types of cryptocurrencies,

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:56.349
that we'll be discussing throughout this program.

00:01:56.349 --> 00:02:01.155
After this video, we'd like for you to review Satoshi Nakamoto Whitepaper yourself.

00:02:01.155 --> 00:02:03.879
As you'll see, the first line already began

00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:06.824
describing how a peer-to-peer electronic cash system,

00:02:06.825 --> 00:02:09.400
can bypass the need for a centralized bank.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.300
From there, the paper discusses topics like transactions,

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.675
time-stamps, proof-of-work, networks and many other topics.

00:02:17.675 --> 00:02:21.570
This paper covers many technical details about how Bitcoin operates,

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.239
and uses terms and concepts you may not be familiar with just yet.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.805
But that's okay.

00:02:26.805 --> 00:02:29.819
Try to focus on just a few key questions.

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.590
"What problem does the Bitcoin try to solve?

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.550
What solutions has it provided?

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.969
What components are used to develop this new system?"

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:40.215
Since I started exploring the blockchain space,

00:02:40.215 --> 00:02:43.015
I've referred back to this Whitepaper several times.

00:02:43.014 --> 00:02:45.479
Many of the concepts that Nakamoto wrote about,

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:48.909
extend beyond Bitcoin, and even beyond cryptocurrency.

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.710
These are concepts that are fundamental to building

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.004
a robust blockchain for any application.

00:02:55.004 --> 00:02:57.819
As the adoption for the blockchain continues to grow,

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.840
debate and discussion will continue to run these topics.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.400
Throughout these discussions, it's nice to go

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.504
back to the source of where it all started, in this Whitepaper.

00:03:06.504 --> 00:03:10.689
Surprisingly, it was only after Bitcoin was developed that we started to

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:15.400
realize the potential of the technology underlying the system, the blockchain.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.620
Abstracting these same ideas to applications beyond

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.270
just financial transactions is how the blockchain

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.260
was able to begin transforming so many industries.

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:26.689
So, take some time now to read through this paper.

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:31.280
It will help you better understand the key points underlying Bitcoin and the blockchain.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.629
You can find the whitepaper@bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf.

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:38.864
We've also linked down below in the instructor notes.

00:03:38.865 --> 00:03:42.320
After you've taken some time to read it through, let us know your thoughts.
