00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.025
Welcome to this lesson on blockchain basics.

00:00:04.025 --> 00:00:07.919
In this lesson, we'll start exploring the fundamental components of the blockchain.

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.439
We'll break open what might seem like a bit of

00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:13.649
a black box to explore the system underlying the blockchain.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.160
These ideas will give you a strong foundation in these new ideas to help

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.679
prepare you to tackle more advanced concepts as we progress through the program.

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:22.890
It'll also help build you towards completing

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.984
the first project where you'll create and manage your own blotching identity.

00:00:26.984 --> 00:00:29.910
Throughout the lesson, we'll often revisit this graphic.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.984
We're calling it the blockchain framework.

00:00:31.984 --> 00:00:35.454
It provides a great overview of the core blockchain components.

00:00:35.454 --> 00:00:37.929
Think of it like a roadmap for the blockchain.

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:40.409
Right now, it's probably not clear what any of

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:42.629
this means but as we progress through the lesson

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.545
we'll use it to define each of these new ideas and explain how they relate to each other.

00:00:47.545 --> 00:00:51.300
We've also put some extra information down below the lesson

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:55.034
to help you get more familiar with the topics we're about to cover.

00:00:55.034 --> 00:00:58.284
If you like, take some time to look through this overview.

00:00:58.284 --> 00:01:00.304
Feel free to jump right in.

00:01:00.304 --> 00:01:06.239
We're really excited you're here and can't wait to get started with blockchain basics.
