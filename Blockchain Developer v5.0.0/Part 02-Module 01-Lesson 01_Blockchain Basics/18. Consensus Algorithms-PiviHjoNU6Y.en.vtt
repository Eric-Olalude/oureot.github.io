00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.759
All right, so we just went over some of the fundamental concepts of

00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:04.439
blockchain and then learned a little more about

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.450
different consensus algorithms that exist.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.080
In the next lesson, we're going to be talking more about managing transactions and also,

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.359
I hope if you could just tell us a little more about how what we just

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:14.924
learned relates to what we're going to be doing in the next lesson.

00:00:14.925 --> 00:00:17.679
Yes, that's great. So honestly,

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:19.530
it all starts with consensus.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.620
We need to make sure that on a peer-to-peer network

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.010
that transactions are approved, right?

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.865
To be embedded into a block on the blockchain.

00:00:26.864 --> 00:00:28.849
So, first we went over consensus and

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.609
the different types of consensus algorithms that we can

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:37.939
utilize on a blockchain platform and with proof of work for Bitcoin Core,

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:39.559
we now want to look at what

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.000
the transaction lifecycle looks like as we're going to embed a transaction into a block.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.094
Great, cool. Yes, so next,

00:00:46.094 --> 00:00:48.784
we're just going to do a quick recap of the lesson and then we're going to transition

00:00:48.784 --> 00:00:50.750
into the next lesson where we're going to start

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.969
talking about managing these transactions for ourselves.
