00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.220
All right. So it's time to wrap up our course.

00:00:03.229 --> 00:00:09.150
What I'd like to do is for you to use the skills you have acquired here,

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.260
especially with regarding to operating status and multi-party,

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.480
to think about the project,

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.339
which is a flight insurance project.

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:22.184
In that project, we will have a scenario where multiple airlines

00:00:22.184 --> 00:00:28.320
will join the contract and provide insurance for passengers.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.914
What we'd like to make sure is that

00:00:30.914 --> 00:00:34.875
no airline can just arbitrarily join the pool of airlines,

00:00:34.875 --> 00:00:41.174
what we want is existing airlines to be able to vote on which airlines can join.

00:00:41.174 --> 00:00:45.199
The requirement in the project will be that at least 33 percent of

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.330
the existing airlines will vote in order to have any new airline join the contract.

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.739
So start thinking about multi-party consensus in that context.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.475
A couple of things to challenge you,

00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:03.505
could the multi-party consensus be implemented as a function modifier?

00:01:03.505 --> 00:01:07.564
So that any function that required that consensus

00:01:07.564 --> 00:01:12.530
would easily have that with one line of code being added to it.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.305
Another thing to challenge you is,

00:01:15.305 --> 00:01:19.080
would it be possible to have a multi-party consensus requirement,

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.079
such that it was time-based?

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:26.554
In other words, you could have an M of N but within a certain duration,

00:01:26.555 --> 00:01:28.445
maybe in an hour,

00:01:28.444 --> 00:01:31.139
a day, a week, etc.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.820
where once the time has elapsed,

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:36.769
if a certain threshold of M had been achieved,

00:01:36.769 --> 00:01:39.049
then the function would be executed.

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.254
So as you can see, multi-party,

00:01:41.254 --> 00:01:44.119
M of N is not just a static concept.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.609
There are many permutations of it.

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:50.254
Some involving time, some involving some other state,

00:01:50.254 --> 00:01:55.054
some involving money, eith in a smart contract, etc.

00:01:55.055 --> 00:01:59.480
So this is a particular feature or capability

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:05.400
that you will want in your tool belt for all future development.
