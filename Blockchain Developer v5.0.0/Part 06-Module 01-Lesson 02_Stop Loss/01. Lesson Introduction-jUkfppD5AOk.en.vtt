00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
So now that we've completed the warm up,

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.400
it's time to start getting into the essence of this course.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.835
We'll look at how we can give our smart contract the ability to be paused.

00:00:14.835 --> 00:00:19.755
The reason why you'd want to do that is to prevent financial loss.

00:00:19.754 --> 00:00:23.939
For example, if you discover a bug in your smart contract and it's executing

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.215
and people are using it to extract funds from the smart contract,

00:00:28.214 --> 00:00:30.390
that's something that you'd want to stop

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.310
immediately while you figure out what is the correct solution to mitigate the problem.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.980
So that's a really good reason to be able to

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:41.219
have the ability to pause your smart contract.

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.818
In a lot of industries,

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:45.320
the term that's used is called stop loss.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.259
This is especially true in retail industry,

00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:52.233
where when there is an adverse situation in progress,

00:00:52.234 --> 00:00:56.630
the first thing you want to do is to be able to prevent further loss.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.980
So that's what we're going to focus on with the operational status.

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:04.519
Before we go on, let's take our first quiz.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.859
What scenarios would require a smart contract to be paused?
