00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
Now let's move on to the next exercise and what we're

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.235
going to do here is now look at the data request capability,

00:00:08.235 --> 00:00:12.015
and we're going to change the fetch flight status function.

00:00:12.015 --> 00:00:13.695
Let's go look at the code first.

00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:18.450
So this is the function that actually does the work

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:24.615
of informing the Oracle what they need to do.

00:00:24.615 --> 00:00:30.510
So the first thing that we need to do here is we want to replace

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:38.625
the hard-coded index we have here with a random index based on the calling account.

00:00:38.625 --> 00:00:40.515
What is the purpose of this?

00:00:40.515 --> 00:00:43.280
If you recollect we said that every time

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.160
there's a request made for fetching flight status,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:53.825
we would generate one independent index that determines which Oracles respond.

00:00:53.825 --> 00:00:59.930
So that's the purpose of generating that here and then what we want to do is we want to

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:08.520
notify the Oracles that the job of fetching the fight status has been assigned.
