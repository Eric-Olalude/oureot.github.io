00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.265
It's time to close up this lesson.

00:00:02.265 --> 00:00:07.005
We've articulated the role of oracles in blockchain environments.

00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:11.745
We've identified scenarios in which oracles are necessary.

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:14.790
We covered the difference between

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.610
trusted and trustless oracles and the various threat vectors.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.790
We developed a Smart Contract that securely

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.110
requests and receives information from oracles.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.130
Thank you, and I'll see you again for the next lesson.
