00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.660
Welcome to the course on blockchain nanodegree.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.689
We are continuing with our lesson.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.245
Our topic is Data from Oracles.

00:00:10.244 --> 00:00:16.274
We're going to review types of oracles and some examples of them in the real world.

00:00:16.274 --> 00:00:20.189
We're going to dive deep into Oracle Security,

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.195
and finally we'll do some coding and create an Oracle Smart Contract.

00:00:25.195 --> 00:00:29.719
The lesson's skills that you will acquire from this lesson

00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:35.225
are: you'll be able to articulate the role of oracles in blockchain environments,

00:00:35.225 --> 00:00:40.015
you'll be able to identify scenarios in which oracles are necessary,

00:00:40.015 --> 00:00:44.960
you'll be able to differentiate between trusted and trustless oracles,

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.853
and you'll learn what those terms mean and also the threat vectors related to oracles,

00:00:50.853 --> 00:00:54.140
and finally, we'll develop a Smart Contract that securely

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.299
requests and receives information from oracles.
