00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.865
Until now, we've mostly focused on

00:00:02.865 --> 00:00:06.320
understanding the blockchain fundamentals using Bitcoin.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.169
You may have noticed the word Ethereum sneaking in more often throughout this lesson.

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:12.945
That's because coming up,

00:00:12.945 --> 00:00:15.740
we'll start to apply a lot of what we know to Ethereum,

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.390
an entirely new blockchain platform.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.359
Before getting started, we wanted to step back and

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.524
mention why we even started learning on the Bitcoin blockchain.

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:29.714
We did this because Bitcoin is often considered the first generation of blockchain.

00:00:29.714 --> 00:00:33.060
Things like transactions and many of the core concepts you

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.750
learned were first developed and implemented on this platform.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.359
The great thing is that many of these ideas were

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:42.314
adopted by future generations of blockchain.

00:00:42.314 --> 00:00:45.229
Soon, we'll move on to the second generation of

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:49.054
blockchain which introduce something known as smart contracts.

00:00:49.054 --> 00:00:53.119
This idea of smart contracts led by Ethereum opened

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:57.059
up many new opportunities to work with digital assets on the blockchain.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.750
But like we mentioned,

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.560
there are a ton of similarities between a Bitcoin blockchain and the Ethereum blockchain.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.710
In this section, we'll give a high-level overview of how

00:01:06.709 --> 00:01:08.539
digital asset management fits into

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.075
the overall scheme of these different blockchain generations.

00:01:12.075 --> 00:01:16.504
Bitcoin, and simple alternative coins like Litecoin and Monero,

00:01:16.504 --> 00:01:21.679
are part of the first generation of blockchain also known as blockchain 1.0.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.620
These blockchains focus on moving value,

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.125
maintaining a ledger, and creating ideal payment systems.

00:01:28.125 --> 00:01:33.424
Blockchain 2.0 build on the concept of recording transactions on the blockchain.

00:01:33.424 --> 00:01:38.825
To do this, they added in the ability to program and use logic associated with this data.

00:01:38.825 --> 00:01:43.100
This code is used to create what we refer to as smart contracts.

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:46.625
Ethereum led the way on this idea but they are quickly joined by

00:01:46.625 --> 00:01:50.484
others like Ethereum Classic, NEO and Quantum.

00:01:50.484 --> 00:01:55.204
Smart contracts on these platforms allow for customizable transactions.

00:01:55.204 --> 00:01:57.739
Engineers can use this functionality to fit

00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:00.584
the needs of whoever is dealing with these transactions.

00:02:00.584 --> 00:02:02.334
They can help exchange money,

00:02:02.334 --> 00:02:05.494
property, shares, or anything of value.

00:02:05.495 --> 00:02:07.454
Similar to other blockchains,

00:02:07.454 --> 00:02:09.409
they try to do this in a transparent,

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:13.120
conflict-free way while avoiding the need for third parties.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.705
You can think of smart contracts as a legal contract that runs on code.

00:02:17.705 --> 00:02:20.719
An event like an expiration date triggers

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:24.389
the contract to execute whatever code is held in it.

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:26.869
The addition of smart contracts allow developers to

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.625
create projects on top of the blockchain platforms,

00:02:29.625 --> 00:02:34.729
as well as launch blockchain-based businesses and organize decentralized governance.

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:38.509
These contract-based applications also give businesses the

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:43.199
potential to automate many tasks and processes that would otherwise be impossible.

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:46.189
It's even allowing us to build entirely new types of

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:49.460
applications known as decentralized apps.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.915
Even though they're considered different generations of blockchain,

00:02:52.914 --> 00:02:55.579
they share a few important similarities.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.935
This is where identity comes in.

00:02:57.935 --> 00:03:01.129
For one, both Bitcoin and Ethereum depend on

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:05.935
wallet addresses to function as identification for transactions and services.

00:03:05.935 --> 00:03:10.145
They're also both a public record of transactions that have taken place.

00:03:10.145 --> 00:03:13.130
They both allow users to autonomously interact with

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:17.460
information on the blockchain while allowing others to verify your data.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.629
Recall on the first project,

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:21.949
you created your own blockchain identity.

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:23.894
This identity was an encrypted,

00:03:23.895 --> 00:03:26.540
private-public key pair from a Bitcoin wallet,

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:28.459
and was used to securely authenticate

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.310
your identity for transactions you posted in the first project.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.555
Even this is extremely similar between Bitcoin and Ethereum.

00:03:36.555 --> 00:03:38.650
Moving forward, we'll segway into

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.905
the Ethereum platform where these same principles apply.

00:03:41.905 --> 00:03:45.375
The main difference is instead of managing transactions,

00:03:45.375 --> 00:03:47.375
we're managing digital assets.

00:03:47.375 --> 00:03:51.004
For example, here's an image of an Ethereum wallet.

00:03:51.004 --> 00:03:53.840
You may have not seen this before but you might be already

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.465
recognizing some similarities between this and your Bitcoin wallet.

00:03:57.465 --> 00:04:02.330
For example, you can see here that the user's account is tied to a key.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.020
So, that wraps up this overview of the different blockchain generations.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.400
It's important to notice the connection of what we're building now

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.115
and how it connects to other platforms and projects you'll be working on.

00:04:14.115 --> 00:04:16.375
As the space continues to grow,

00:04:16.375 --> 00:04:18.470
these basic ideas will stay pretty similar.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.830
We'll always have amazing new tools as the blockchain continues to grow,

00:04:22.829 --> 00:04:28.409
but staying focused on these core ideas will help you learn these platforms more easily.
