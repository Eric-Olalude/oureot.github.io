Congratulations, you've reached the end of this lesson.

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.004
Throughout this lesson, we worked with encoding and decoding digital assets.

00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:10.830
After that, we moved on to a proof of existence

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.095
and touched on the basics of different block chain generations.

00:00:14.095 --> 00:00:18.855
The goal is to help you implement this type of functionality on your private block chain.

00:00:18.855 --> 00:00:23.780
This allows you to start posting assets as data into a new block in the block chain.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.855
It also helps you manage assets like images, videos, audio files,

00:00:27.855 --> 00:00:30.230
and other digital assets in the same way you've

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.054
been able to manage transactions with your web service.

00:00:33.054 --> 00:00:36.670
This lesson was also meant to help prepare you for the next project.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.545
We will be adding some functionality to your web service.

00:00:39.545 --> 00:00:42.905
We've put a quick review of what was covered down below the video.

00:00:42.905 --> 00:00:45.829
Take some time to review these ideas and when you're ready,

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.299
move on to the project to get started.
