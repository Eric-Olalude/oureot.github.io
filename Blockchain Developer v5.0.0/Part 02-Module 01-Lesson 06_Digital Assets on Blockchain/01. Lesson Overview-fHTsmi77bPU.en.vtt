00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.555
Hey, and welcome to the lesson.

00:00:02.555 --> 00:00:05.070
In this lesson, we'll extend beyond some of

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.634
the basic ideas of web services we went over previously.

00:00:08.634 --> 00:00:11.460
We'll help you build some extra functionality into

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.195
your private blockchain that helps you work with digital assets.

00:00:15.195 --> 00:00:18.269
You'll learn to encode and decode these assets,

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:22.429
which will allow you to post them as data and a new block on the blockchain.

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:24.530
But why would you want to do this?

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.645
Well, first, our blockchain is currently limited

00:00:27.644 --> 00:00:30.919
to storing basic values to help validate transactions.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.355
But using these same core concepts with just some added functionality,

00:00:35.354 --> 00:00:40.179
we can extend this idea of validating ownership to digital assets like png,

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:42.945
jpeg, mp3s, and more.

00:00:42.945 --> 00:00:45.049
To get there we'll start by learning

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:48.765
a few new concepts like what exactly a digital asset is,

00:00:48.765 --> 00:00:50.920
what encoding and decoding are,

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.755
and then you'll get some practice doing this for yourself in Node.js.

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:57.040
On top of learning these new ideas,

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:00.539
our goal is to help prepare you to complete the next project.

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.890
There, you'll extend the functionality of your private blockchain to

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.234
include the ability to notarize digital documents for yourself.

00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:09.170
For more details, you can read through some of

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.025
the text we've placed down below the video,

00:01:11.025 --> 00:01:14.120
and when you're ready, we'll see you in the next section.
