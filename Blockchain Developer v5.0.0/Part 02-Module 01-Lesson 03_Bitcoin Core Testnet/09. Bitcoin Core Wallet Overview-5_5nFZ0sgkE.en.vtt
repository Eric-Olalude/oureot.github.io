00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.655
Once you get your Bitcoin Core Wallet,

00:00:03.655 --> 00:00:07.890
it helps to takes some time to get used to the basic functionality available to you.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.360
And in this video,

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.360
we'll overview the basics of this wallet to help get you familiar with this new tool.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.310
When you first load up your wallet,

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.645
you'll see a note showing how far along your wallet has synced.

00:00:18.645 --> 00:00:21.475
It shows the number of blocks left along

00:00:21.475 --> 00:00:24.940
with some other information down by the bottom of the screen.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.050
Now this is helpful but I generally

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.700
hide this right away to get to the more important information.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.760
After hiding the first screen,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.515
we will be on the overview page of your wallet.

00:00:38.515 --> 00:00:41.440
This is where you'll see things like the balance that you have

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.440
available as well as the recent transactions you've made.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.800
Along the top here is the navigation bar that you

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.345
can use to access other parts of your wallet. Let's click "Send".

00:00:54.345 --> 00:00:59.530
From here, we can see the details about sending transactions using your Bitcoin wallet.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.810
If you've previously used another wallet like Electrum for example,

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.955
some of this might look familiar.

00:01:05.955 --> 00:01:07.680
To send a transaction,

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.040
your Bitcoin wallet requests an address to pay to,

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.245
a label to help organize the transaction and an amount.

00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:21.090
You can use these buttons here on the right to

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.955
copy this information if you need to use it elsewhere.

00:01:23.955 --> 00:01:25.560
Along the bottom here,

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.450
you'll see a transaction fee that you can setup for

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.375
yourself as well as the ability to send,

00:01:30.375 --> 00:01:35.070
clear information, and add new recipients through the transaction.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.270
Next up, navigate to the received panel.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.815
This again hopefully looks pretty similar to other wallets you've used.

00:01:46.815 --> 00:01:51.635
Here, you have the option to request Bitcoin using your wallet.

00:01:51.635 --> 00:01:53.690
You can enter a label,

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.335
an amount and a message to the recipient.

00:01:56.335 --> 00:01:59.940
Once making a request, you'll also be able to see details like

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.910
the date and other details of the requests in this window down below.

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.300
Now let's navigate to the transaction window.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.850
Here, you'll see the details of all transactions that happened using your wallet.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.855
While the overview window gave us a set of recent transaction,

00:02:16.855 --> 00:02:20.370
this screen gives you a list of every transaction.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.855
You can organize these transactions by the date,

00:02:23.855 --> 00:02:29.585
type, label, and amount similar to ordering a spreadsheet.

00:02:29.585 --> 00:02:34.030
Along the top, you also have the option to search for specific transactions using

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.790
any field or by setting constraints

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.740
to get back any transaction that meets a certain criteria.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.740
Now that we've seen each window on the main screen,

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.795
let's navigate to other parts of the wallet using the file menu.

00:02:54.795 --> 00:02:58.465
So along the top here you'll see "Bitcoin Core",

00:02:58.465 --> 00:03:00.790
"File", "Settings" and "Help".

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.170
Under "File", you can sign and verify

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.905
a message as well as access you're sending and receiving addresses.

00:03:09.905 --> 00:03:13.515
Using "Help", you can access a "Search" bar,

00:03:13.515 --> 00:03:18.625
the "Debug" window and "Command-line Options" that are available in the tool.

00:03:18.625 --> 00:03:21.640
The debug console is a tool that we'll be using to

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.525
explore blockchain data later throughout the lesson.

00:03:24.525 --> 00:03:27.075
Now the command line options are really helpful,

00:03:27.075 --> 00:03:29.170
but they're for a different use in this case.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.110
These allow you to access blockchain data from beyond

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.505
the debug console using these command-line options.

00:03:35.505 --> 00:03:38.740
We won't be going over this in this lesson but

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.015
it will be helpful later on when we start building applications.

00:03:42.015 --> 00:03:46.150
Finally, it helps to know where all of this information is coming from.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.010
If you haven't already checked back to

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.270
the directory where you saved your Bitcoin Core client,

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.240
try navigating there now.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.230
If you've saved it to the default location and forgot where it was,

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.735
check out the link down below.

00:03:57.735 --> 00:03:59.905
So on the Mac, it's listed as,

00:03:59.905 --> 00:04:04.895
saved under library/application support/ Bitcoin.

00:04:04.895 --> 00:04:09.785
What you'll see is all the information that is available for your copy of the blockchain.

00:04:09.785 --> 00:04:13.410
In there you'll find the blocks, chained state,

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.615
log, test network, wallet and a few other features.

00:04:17.615 --> 00:04:22.940
You might not see the bitcoin.conf file like I have here just yet and that's fine.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.850
This is a file that you can use to override some of the standard functionality of

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.530
the application but we'll get you set up with your own Bitcoin configuration file soon.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.960
Now these are all the basic options available to

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.765
you when getting started with the Bitcoin Core Wallet.

00:04:36.765 --> 00:04:39.870
Coming up, we'll dig a little deeper into this tool and get

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.750
our hands dirty with the options available to us as developers.
