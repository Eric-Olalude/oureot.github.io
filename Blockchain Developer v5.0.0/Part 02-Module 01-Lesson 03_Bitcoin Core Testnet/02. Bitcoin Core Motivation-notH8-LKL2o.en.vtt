Hey guys, and welcome to the lesson on Bitcoin core.

00:00:03.464 --> 00:00:05.375
So with that, I want to ask you,

00:00:05.375 --> 00:00:07.750
why did we choose Bitcoin core for this lesson?

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.379
So, honestly the motivation was the fact that

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.270
Bitcoin core literally was the original Bitcoin.

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.750
So, Bitcoin, when Satoshi Nakamoto released it to the community,

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.870
it went through a lot of trials and tribulations especially when we started doing

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.210
soft forks and hard forks and we have new forks like Bitcoin cash,

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.200
which almost adds confusion to the adoption of this technology.

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.039
So, the original community decided to go with

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:38.089
Bitcoin core because it is the core bitcoin that literally started it all.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.275
And so we wanted to go ahead and establish the fundamentals right from the source.

00:00:42.274 --> 00:00:44.829
Right? And that's why we selected Bitcoin core.

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.629
That makes sense. So going back to where it all started,

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.719
there was a lot of work that's been done on it through the years.

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.280
With that in mind, what excites you about Bitcoin core?

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.939
Number one excitement is the fact that it was the original, right.

00:00:55.939 --> 00:01:01.789
I like the idea that we can take something that was so new and improve it over time.

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:05.049
And so, honestly, by admiring Bitcoin Core,

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:08.549
it allows me to respect the motivations the fork with

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.219
Bitcoin cash and the new technologies that we're

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:14.275
seeing float today within the blockchain space.

00:01:14.275 --> 00:01:17.060
And so to me it reminds me of the fundamentals.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.460
That's another reason why I absolutely love Bitcoin core.

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:22.049
It's because it just establishes those fundamentals for

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.039
me and I believe for everybody in the community.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.680
Yeah. We can see a lot of the basics actually all

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.280
go back to it and so we can really experience it there.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.715
So do have any advice for students as they're starting off this lesson?

00:01:35.715 --> 00:01:38.060
Yes. So the tooling is extremely important.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.144
And as we noticed,

00:01:40.144 --> 00:01:42.000
there's so many different platforms.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.159
So some of the things that we're going to do with

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.399
Bitcoin core is really focus on what type of

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:53.150
tooling is there and that tooling should allow an introduction to other platforms.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.590
We want to try keeping it as universal as possible.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.890
So, the message that we're going to learn within our program is absolutely

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.555
adaptable no matter what platform you decide to choose within the blockchain space.

00:02:03.555 --> 00:02:06.995
Yeah. I think that's a great perspective to have as they're beginning this lesson.

00:02:06.995 --> 00:02:09.340
Well, so with that, let's get started
