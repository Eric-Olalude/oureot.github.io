00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.835
Alright. You made it to the end of the lesson.

00:00:03.835 --> 00:00:09.419
In this lesson, we discussed an overview of the Bitcoin Core Networks then,

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:12.554
compared Mainnet, Testsnet, and Regnet.

00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:15.804
We set up a Bitcoin Core Full Node Wallet,

00:00:15.804 --> 00:00:18.800
obtained Testnet Coins and lastly,

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.570
completed and explored a transaction.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.605
Getting comfortable with these tools will help you complete your next project,

00:00:25.605 --> 00:00:28.304
where you'll build your own private block chain.

00:00:28.304 --> 00:00:29.839
And in the next lesson,

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:32.380
you'll build on these skills and use commands in

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.429
the debug console to explore components of the block chain.

00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:38.539
When you're ready we'll see you there.
