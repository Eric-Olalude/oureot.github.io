00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.294
Howdy, everybody?

00:00:01.294 --> 00:00:02.780
So, we're back with Brandy.

00:00:02.779 --> 00:00:04.169
And we just covered a lot about

00:00:04.169 --> 00:00:07.500
Bitcoin core and learned a bunch about the different types of networks.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.929
With that, why is it important that we know

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.814
that these different networks exists and what should we know about them?

00:00:12.814 --> 00:00:15.224
Well, if you haven't noticed, it's really about

00:00:15.224 --> 00:00:18.934
focusing on the development cycle for applications,

00:00:18.934 --> 00:00:20.879
and there's so many different stages when you develop

00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:23.869
an application and that's why we have different network types.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.780
So, there's times where you want to use

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.020
regression testing because you need to stay in your silo,

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.300
within your own little development sandbox.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.844
Once your new application starts maturing and you want

00:00:32.844 --> 00:00:36.640
other folks to be able to interact with your application,

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.070
that's the power of the testNet,.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.880
You don't have to sit there and expense large value to do a transaction with a testNet.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.219
It's like a free resource for the development communities.

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:50.679
I really love how that bring so much reward to the developer with the testNet.

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:52.369
And that's why we utilize blockish pool,

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:57.905
so we can actually see that transaction line on the public network with the testNet,

00:00:57.905 --> 00:00:59.925
and then we have the public mainNet,

00:00:59.924 --> 00:01:03.359
and that's for production because that's where you're going to

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.980
actually expense solid value with that transaction.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.215
So, you want to be really cautious and also pay attention to security.

00:01:10.215 --> 00:01:11.850
Yeah. I think it's really exciting that we

00:01:11.849 --> 00:01:13.519
have all these different environments that we can

00:01:13.519 --> 00:01:16.765
play with and different reasons for using them, and it's important,

00:01:16.765 --> 00:01:18.310
especially as a beginning developer,

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.010
to keep in mind like you mentioned,

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.790
as we're going through the development process,

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.840
to know when is the best time to use each of them.
