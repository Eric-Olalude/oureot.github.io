00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
Welcome to the lesson on planning a blockchain solution.

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.890
In this lesson, we'll discuss the architecture of a blockchain

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.850
and then use this to inform how our plan and design a blockchain solution.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.805
I know too often we're tasked to build a project.

00:00:14.805 --> 00:00:17.370
We get very eager to dive in and start building.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.455
I know I've definitely been guilty of that.

00:00:19.455 --> 00:00:24.390
If we were to just take a step back and just a little bit of extra time up front to plan,

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.570
it would help us recognize and plan around avoidable pit falls down

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.310
the road and save months of rework and a little bit of everyone's entity down the road.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.685
Now, let's consider an electronic medical record system

00:00:35.685 --> 00:00:38.040
that allows medical providers to securely and

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.575
efficiently access patient health information about

00:00:40.575 --> 00:00:44.150
thousands of patients across the entire Southern California region.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.555
The system needs to help medical providers securely and

00:00:47.555 --> 00:00:51.560
accurately access information about their patients health across time,

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.650
be able to submit information to other parties such as labs or

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.980
pharmacies as well as accurately trigger billing information.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.300
This electronic medical record system is looking to integrate blockchain solutions.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.515
Because a blockchain solution involves several layers such as a blockchain,

00:01:06.515 --> 00:01:11.090
smart contract and web services that need to plan becomes even more important.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.970
Not only are there additional layers to consider but

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.585
these new layers need to integrate well with an existing legacy system.

00:01:17.585 --> 00:01:20.390
We also noticed that the data will need to securely

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.735
pass through several actors from the medical provider,

00:01:23.735 --> 00:01:28.145
to the patient, to the labs pharmacies and even to the billing department.

00:01:28.145 --> 00:01:32.480
So, each transaction will include multiple users with different permissions.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.325
This is even more to consider.

00:01:34.325 --> 00:01:36.935
In this term we'll be building towards

00:01:36.935 --> 00:01:39.640
architecting a blockchain solution for supply chain.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.520
With all that in mind we'll be overviewing a blockchain architecture.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.255
Then planning how to architect a blockchain solution.

00:01:47.255 --> 00:01:52.095
Next, we'll cover an overview of the tools which includes UML,

00:01:52.095 --> 00:01:53.980
which is used for modeling behavior,

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.110
instructional interactions in the smart contract as well as

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.130
the data model diagram which is used to model contract relationships.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.345
We'll also talk about decisions when layering services.

00:02:04.345 --> 00:02:08.315
By the end of this lesson you'll be familiar with blocking architecture.

00:02:08.315 --> 00:02:10.700
Using this knowledge you'll be able to plan

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.140
blockchain services and model this using UML in data model diagrams.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.235
Along the way you get a chance to have hands on practice

00:02:18.235 --> 00:02:22.385
brainstorming your own supply chain idea and modeling its functionality.

00:02:22.385 --> 00:02:25.070
With all that, let's get started.
