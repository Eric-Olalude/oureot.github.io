00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.749
In this lesson, we discussed the architecture of a Blockchain,

00:00:03.749 --> 00:00:08.040
and then use this to inform how we planned and designed a Blockchain solution.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:09.869
So, to wrap up this concept,

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:12.974
we covered an overview of the Blockchain architecture,

00:00:12.974 --> 00:00:18.144
focusing on the evolution of the web from web 1.0 to 2.0 to 3.0.

00:00:18.144 --> 00:00:21.469
As well as what architectural changes need to happen in order

00:00:21.469 --> 00:00:24.799
to advance the Web from Web 2.0 to 3.0.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.999
Then we dove into planning by using UML to model the activity,

00:00:28.998 --> 00:00:30.799
sequence and state changes,

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.174
in our pet shop simple business to consumer example.

00:00:34.174 --> 00:00:36.259
You took this information and created

00:00:36.259 --> 00:00:39.724
UML diagrams of your own for a simple supply chain solution.

00:00:39.725 --> 00:00:43.370
Using this information, we created our data model diagram

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:47.379
to draft the relationships amongst the smart contracts that we'll be building.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.905
Lastly, we ask questions about the network, performance,

00:00:50.905 --> 00:00:52.880
business logic and consensus,

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.790
to help us decide how to narrow down these choices for a platform and database solution.
