00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
Welcome to the lesson, blockchain transactions.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.799
Previously, we went over

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.140
some fundamental blockchain concepts and got an overview of some basic terminology.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.560
These are important skills for

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.960
any blockchain developer to understand how to interact with the blockchain.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.280
In this lesson, we'll build upon the knowledge and

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.925
learn what it takes to manage transactions on the blockchain.

00:00:20.925 --> 00:00:23.010
This is where the fun happens.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.065
We're going to introduce the blockchain transaction lifecycle,

00:00:26.065 --> 00:00:29.710
which builds on the blockchain overview from the last lesson.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.289
We'll continue to build on these core concepts to put these ideas into

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:37.274
practice by establishing your own identity on the blockchain.

00:00:37.274 --> 00:00:38.890
By the end of this lesson,

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.009
you'll be ready for the first project.

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:44.045
You'll start to manage your own blockchain identity.

00:00:44.045 --> 00:00:47.075
We've put some more details about the lesson down below the video.

00:00:47.075 --> 00:00:49.070
Read through it if you'd like some more context about

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.250
the lesson or dive right in and start the first concept.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.719
These are some of my favorite topics and I can't wait to get started. Let's get going.
