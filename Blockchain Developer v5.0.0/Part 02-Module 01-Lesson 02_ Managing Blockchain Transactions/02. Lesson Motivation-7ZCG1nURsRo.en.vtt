00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.375
Hey, guys. So we just saw an overview of what we'll be covering in this lesson.

00:00:04.375 --> 00:00:06.435
So managing Blockchain transactions.

00:00:06.434 --> 00:00:10.744
So the question is, why is it important to understand how to manage transactions?

00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:12.369
Well, if you haven't noticed Jessica,

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:15.285
transactions is literally the lifeline of Blockchain.

00:00:15.285 --> 00:00:18.504
Without transactions, all we have is blocks on the chain,

00:00:18.504 --> 00:00:20.449
and they're literally wouldn't do anything.

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:23.280
Like, what purpose would just blocks do without a way to

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.520
transact and have a storage for data,

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.995
and transaction literally allows us to

00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:32.829
manipulate data and transact and that's what goes into a block on a Blockchain.

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:34.875
So it's extremely important to understand

00:00:34.875 --> 00:00:38.009
the types of transactions and way we can work with them.

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:39.869
It's a really interesting way to think about it.

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:42.079
It's our way of interacting with the Blockchain.

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.789
Otherwise it's just a static entity right there.

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.250
So with this course, we have associated project so,

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.719
the Blockchain identity Project.

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.019
So how or what they're learning here relate to that project?

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.240
That too is a really critical question to address.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.679
So first, I would like to acknowledge the fact

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:02.219
that your Blockchain identity is something that you own.

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.500
You get to manage, and nobody else can manipulate it,

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.495
unless if you are given your private key.

00:01:06.495 --> 00:01:08.875
So something that you get to control.

00:01:08.875 --> 00:01:11.459
Every time that you transact on a Blockchain,

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:15.070
you're going to have to go ahead and sign that transaction with your private key.

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:17.469
So it's critical to understand your block chain identity.

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:19.200
Yes, you bring up some really good points.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.409
So with that, let's actually learn about our Blockchain identity.
