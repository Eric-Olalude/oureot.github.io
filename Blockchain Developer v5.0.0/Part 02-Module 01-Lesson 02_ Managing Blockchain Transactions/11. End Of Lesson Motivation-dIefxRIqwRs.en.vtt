Hey guys and welcome back to another segment of Block Talk with Brandi.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.459
And so, in this part, we'll be asking-

00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:09.410
we just covered a lot about the transaction life cycle,

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.980
we've been focusing specifically on Bitcoin.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.919
I'm just wondering how did these principles

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:16.504
apply and do they apply to other block chains?

00:00:16.504 --> 00:00:21.460
Absolutely, so, anytime that you establish identity on a block chain you need to

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.589
manage that identity and as you notice it's backed by your private and public key,

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:28.890
and you want to really keep that private key secure.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.460
So, the same principles that all of us have learned throughout

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.320
the lesson is applicable on almost any platform that deals with block chain technologies.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.609
You still have an identity,

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:40.810
it needs to be managed,

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.630
and you want it secure so if there's anything that we're trying to get out of

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.969
all this is the power of keeping your identity secure.

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.439
Nice. That's a very key point to take away and I thought

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:53.424
the power of what we're learning is universal.

00:00:53.424 --> 00:00:56.570
So with that, let's take it to the course recap.
