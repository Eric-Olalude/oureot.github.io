00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.839
As we've alluded to storing non-currency data on

00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:05.250
a Blockchain where that wasn't

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.750
the intended purpose is a matter of debate in the Bitcoin community.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.074
Is it ethically correct?

00:00:11.074 --> 00:00:15.449
On the one hand, the Bitcoin Blockchain is a secure decentralized method

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:19.714
for data storage on which applications beyond financial ones can leverage.

00:00:19.714 --> 00:00:22.140
Allowing data storage would help promote

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.214
the growth and long-term relevance of the Bitcoin platform.

00:00:25.214 --> 00:00:29.475
Some in this camp believed that the Blockchain should be a public resource

00:00:29.475 --> 00:00:32.130
available for whomever to use as long as they

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.304
paid for sufficient transaction fee for the miners.

00:00:35.304 --> 00:00:38.960
On the other hand, other community members believe

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.225
the Bitcoin Blockchain should only be used for Bitcoin transaction data,

00:00:43.225 --> 00:00:46.700
and any other type of data should be stored separately.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.790
Regardless of which side of the debate you may fall,

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:53.494
the importance of scalability issues cannot be avoided.

00:00:53.494 --> 00:00:55.269
Adding data to the network,

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.280
especially network where data cannot be erased,

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.350
raises the maintenance costs and adds a burden to everyone involved.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.710
Every time a four node downloads the Blockchain,

00:01:05.709 --> 00:01:10.759
all the data takes up memory that someone somewhere has to pay for.
