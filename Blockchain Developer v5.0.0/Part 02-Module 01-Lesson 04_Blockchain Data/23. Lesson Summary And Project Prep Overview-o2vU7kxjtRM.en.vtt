00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.910
In this lesson, we explored the limitations and

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.714
best practices when embedding data in blockchain transactions.

00:00:06.714 --> 00:00:10.905
To recap, you learned the data structure of blocks and transactions.

00:00:10.904 --> 00:00:14.579
You became familiar with the purpose of Bitcoin scripts and OP codes,

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.765
which are commonly used in the inputs and outputs of a transaction.

00:00:17.765 --> 00:00:22.033
Then, you got the chance to dive into a real life raw transaction.

00:00:22.033 --> 00:00:24.869
Lastly, we discussed the limitations and

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.054
best practices of embedding data in blockchain transactions.

00:00:29.054 --> 00:00:32.380
Now, that wraps it up for the new topics in this lesson.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.390
In the next lesson, you'll bring together all that you've learned about

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.905
blockchain data models to create

00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:40.990
a simple block chain all from scratch with your instructor.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.270
This hands-on practice will help you with the project that's associated with

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.530
this course where you'll create your very own private blockchain.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.380
You'll build a blockchain focusing on the collection of

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.740
data and stringing together blocks via their hashes.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.990
This will be a low-complexity blockchain

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.030
that doesn't implement any formal consensus just yet.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.774
However, your blockchain will be able to create new blocks,

00:01:03.774 --> 00:01:05.640
store data within the blocks,

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.140
and perform transactions, and secure the blocks with a digital signature.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.540
Now, with so much to do let's get started.
