00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.365
Welcome back to class. So, far in the course,

00:00:03.365 --> 00:00:05.595
you've learned a lot about Bitcoin core,

00:00:05.594 --> 00:00:07.714
creating transactions in the wallet gooey,

00:00:07.714 --> 00:00:10.744
and cover a number of debug console commands.

00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:13.649
In this lesson, our two big takeaways will

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.920
be understanding transactions and blocks as data models,

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.845
and understanding how to use the information that's stored inside of them.

00:00:19.844 --> 00:00:24.154
Any blockchain platform you end up working with will be transaction-based.

00:00:24.155 --> 00:00:29.714
Whether you plan on building your own blockchain or leveraging an existing blockchain,

00:00:29.714 --> 00:00:33.865
understanding how the data is structured will help you use it more efficiently.

00:00:33.865 --> 00:00:37.050
We'll run up the lesson on a more philosophical note,

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:42.129
discussing the ethics and best practices when embedding data in blockchain transactions.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.620
To summarize, by the end of this lesson you'll be able

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:49.348
to recognize the Data Structure of Blocks and Transactions,

00:00:49.348 --> 00:00:52.909
recognize the purpose of Bitcoin Script Opcodes and these

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:56.544
are commonly used in the inputs and outputs of the transaction process,

00:00:56.545 --> 00:00:59.359
and lastly explore the limitations and

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:02.869
best practices of Embedding Data in Blockchain Transactions.

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:06.359
Using these skills will help you with the next lesson where you'll build

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:11.019
all components of your own private simple blockchain off from scratch.
