00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
Okay, so now that we have created our raw transaction,

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.375
we have signed it, we are all ready to send it to the network.

00:00:06.375 --> 00:00:09.660
The command that you're going to use for this is called send raw transaction,

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.820
followed by the hex string of the raw transaction.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.490
Once we do this, we will get a transaction hash back.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.140
So let's go back to a debug console.

00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:19.724
Once you go back to debug console,

00:00:19.725 --> 00:00:20.880
I'm going to go fine,

00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:23.804
and let me get this screen a little bit bigger for you all to see better.

00:00:23.804 --> 00:00:27.495
So once we decode and signed it,

00:00:27.495 --> 00:00:29.339
we got a hex string back.

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:32.320
I'm going to go copy this.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.939
So this is the transaction ID or the hex string that we got back.

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:40.589
The command that we used, like I said,

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.955
is called send raw transaction.

00:00:44.954 --> 00:00:48.679
Once we have that, I'm going to paste this complete hex string that we got after

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:54.375
signing our UTXL, fantastic.

00:00:54.375 --> 00:00:55.799
So once we do that,

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:57.979
like I said, everything has all gone through.

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:01.414
So now you have finally sent this transaction to the network.

00:01:01.414 --> 00:01:03.609
This is a transaction hash back.

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:06.094
You get this complete transaction hash back.

00:01:06.094 --> 00:01:07.909
Now fantastic.

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:09.349
This is how you send a transaction.

00:01:09.349 --> 00:01:10.459
In the next step,

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:13.219
I'm actually going to show you how to make sure that everything went fine.

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:16.650
So that is something that is covered in the next step.
