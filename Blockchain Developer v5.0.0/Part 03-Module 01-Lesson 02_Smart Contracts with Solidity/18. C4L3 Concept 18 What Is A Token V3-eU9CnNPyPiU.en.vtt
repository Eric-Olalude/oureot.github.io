00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
In this concept, we will learn about what are

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.290
tokens and how to create tokens on a blockchain network.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.179
Now, to understand tokens,

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.089
we need to understand what are token contracts.

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:15.990
Essentially, a token contract is a smart contract that

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.144
contains a mapping of account addresses and their balances.

00:00:20.144 --> 00:00:25.439
The balance can represent anything of value not just necessarily Ether.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.270
It will represent a value that is defined by the contract creator.

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.875
So, balances can be used to represent physical objects

00:00:34.875 --> 00:00:41.034
or monetary value or some kind of license or any other asset.

00:00:41.034 --> 00:00:44.959
The unit of this balance is commonly called a token.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.359
Once you write a token contract,

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:50.015
then it gets deployed on the network.

00:00:50.015 --> 00:00:53.119
These token contracts have some standards that

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:56.659
need to be followed to be a standardized token.

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:00.934
ERC stands for Ethereum Request for Comments.

00:01:00.935 --> 00:01:03.530
Now, these are technical documents that are used

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.469
by smart contract developers at Ethereum.

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:12.379
They define a set of rules required to implement the tokens for the theorem ecosystem.

00:01:12.379 --> 00:01:15.155
It makes standardization easy since

00:01:15.155 --> 00:01:19.320
everyone knows what functions the token contract will have.
