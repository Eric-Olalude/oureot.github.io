00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.924
Welcome to our lesson on solidity.

00:00:02.924 --> 00:00:05.955
I'm going to be your instructor for this lesson.

00:00:05.955 --> 00:00:10.640
Have you always wanted to be able to write your own smart contracts?

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.700
Have you wondered what token contracts are?

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:19.379
How about creating your own tokens and then being able to view them on EtherScan?

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:23.864
Or, how about being able to send your own tokens to your friends?

00:00:23.864 --> 00:00:27.029
We will cover all these topics in this lesson.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.515
We will start with learning solidity,

00:00:29.515 --> 00:00:33.005
the main language used to write contracts on Ethereum.

00:00:33.005 --> 00:00:36.085
We will then learn the syntax of this language,

00:00:36.085 --> 00:00:39.243
and then look at many samples, smart contracts.

00:00:39.243 --> 00:00:41.659
Once we get comfortable with this language,

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:45.774
we will then talk about token contracts and token standards.

00:00:45.774 --> 00:00:51.274
Next, we will show you how to create your own tokens and then send them to your friends.

00:00:51.274 --> 00:00:53.629
Lots of exciting stuff to learn in this lesson,

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.280
so let's get started
