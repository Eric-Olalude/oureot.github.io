00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.725
Congratulations!

00:00:01.725 --> 00:00:03.810
You have now learned Solidity,

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.515
the most popular language for writing smart contracts.

00:00:07.514 --> 00:00:12.149
You now have the tools and the knowledge to write your own contracts,

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.850
deploy them on any of the public networks,

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.445
or even on a local test network.

00:00:17.445 --> 00:00:20.460
We learned how to use Remix to interact with

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.789
your contracts and to call various functions on them.

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.324
You also learned what tokens are,

00:00:26.324 --> 00:00:29.640
and how to create your own ERC-20 tokens,

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.560
and then view them on either scan.

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:35.449
You also learned how you could send your own tokens to your friends.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.240
You are truly getting closer to being a blockchain expert.
