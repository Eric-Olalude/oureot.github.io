00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.705
Welcome to the Blockchain Nanodegree course.

00:00:03.705 --> 00:00:07.425
We're going to continue our lessons today and focus on

00:00:07.424 --> 00:00:14.265
the Dapp user experience and also dive into the details of the flight surety project.

00:00:14.265 --> 00:00:17.880
So this is the culmination of this course.

00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:22.769
What we want to do is, make sure that you have all the information and all the skills

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.605
necessary to complete the project and be very successful at it.

00:00:28.605 --> 00:00:32.744
To that end, our topics for today are first

00:00:32.744 --> 00:00:37.155
a review of best practices for Web3 applications.

00:00:37.155 --> 00:00:40.814
We've focused a lot on code during the prior lessons,

00:00:40.814 --> 00:00:43.789
and what I want to talk about today is some of

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:48.814
the design aspects that make for really good applications.

00:00:48.814 --> 00:00:53.209
Next, we'll review the requirements for the flight surety project.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.929
You will have your rubric that you'll follow but ultimately,

00:00:56.929 --> 00:00:58.789
I wanted to make sure that all

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:03.754
the requirements and the architecture of the project is clear to you.

00:01:03.755 --> 00:01:07.534
Finally, we'll walk through the code that

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:11.435
I've prepared for you to work through the flight surety project.

00:01:11.435 --> 00:01:16.265
We'll go through every aspect of it so that as you dive into coding yourself,

00:01:16.265 --> 00:01:22.310
you're familiar with how to perhaps launch or build and things like that.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.754
The specific lesson skills that we are focusing on

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:33.469
in this session are to develop Dapps with great user experiences.

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:35.525
You can have the best smart contract,

00:01:35.525 --> 00:01:37.445
the most robust and secure one,

00:01:37.444 --> 00:01:40.459
you can have the best APIs, etc., but ultimately,

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:44.769
let's not forget that there's a human who is going to use this,

00:01:44.769 --> 00:01:46.325
and we want to make sure that

00:01:46.325 --> 00:01:50.540
the user experiences we build into our apps are a really good and

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:57.610
really designed to make people be productive and use all the technology we're developing.

00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:07.204
Next, I want to review the server code that has many modern techniques for development.

00:02:07.204 --> 00:02:09.169
So while reviewing that,

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:13.039
you will learn different techniques that'll help you in other projects as well to

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:18.215
ensure that you are working in the most productive way possible when you're writing code.

00:02:18.215 --> 00:02:23.219
Finally, you will learn the requirements for the flight surety project.

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:29.870
With that, let's get started with talking about Dapp user experiences.
