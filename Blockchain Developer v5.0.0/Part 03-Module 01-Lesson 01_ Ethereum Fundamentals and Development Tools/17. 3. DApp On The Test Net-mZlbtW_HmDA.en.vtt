00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.155
In this video, we'll go over how to launch your DApp to the test and main networks.

00:00:04.155 --> 00:00:06.315
To do that, we'll use Node.js,

00:00:06.315 --> 00:00:08.730
Web3, Remix, and Infura.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.574
This is a quick and effective way to see your transactions live on these networks.

00:00:13.574 --> 00:00:18.030
Once you get used to it, you don't really have to do things in the exact order I do here,

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.380
but to show you how,

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:21.794
I've broken this process down into five steps.

00:00:21.795 --> 00:00:25.620
First, you'll point Web3 to the test network using Infura.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.205
Next, you'll ensure MetaMask is connected to the test network.

00:00:29.204 --> 00:00:31.334
Then, deploy your contract.

00:00:31.335 --> 00:00:35.384
After that, replace the contract address in your code editor.

00:00:35.384 --> 00:00:38.579
Finally, test that everything is working correctly.

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.859
Okay. So, let's get started.

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:44.130
First, navigate back to your Infura dashboard.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.795
From there, make sure the drop-down is selecting the correct network.

00:00:47.795 --> 00:00:50.050
In our case, that will be Rinkeby.

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:53.419
Now, copy the URL and replace the URL in

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.079
your code editor that was originally pointing towards ganache.

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.634
Next, check that MetaMask is on the right network.

00:01:00.634 --> 00:01:05.045
Again, you want to make sure that it's on Rinkeby and that you've got some Ether there.

00:01:05.045 --> 00:01:06.859
Now that you're on the right network,

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:11.239
your Remix contract should say that it's connected to an injected Web3 environment.

00:01:11.239 --> 00:01:13.099
That's perfect. If it isn't,

00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:15.409
you can update it to say this now.

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.569
Having lined up the networks,

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:19.179
you can deploy the contract.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.660
Hit Deploy, and a window should pop up for

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.344
MetaMask asking you to confirm this transaction.

00:01:24.344 --> 00:01:28.144
Hit confirm and the transaction will be sent to the test network.

00:01:28.144 --> 00:01:30.829
Like before, there will be some waiting time and

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:33.969
you can check out the transaction on Etherscan if you'd like.

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:36.120
Once the transaction goes through,

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.775
your contract should appear back in Remix.

00:01:38.775 --> 00:01:42.420
The last thing to do is grab the deployed contract address.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.609
Copy this address and replace the current address from your editor.

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:49.224
That's it, you're all set up.

00:01:49.224 --> 00:01:52.089
Save your file, go to your DApp browser,

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.510
and refresh the page.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:54.950
Try sending a message,

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.254
and a window should appear again from MetaMask asking you to confirm the transaction.

00:01:59.254 --> 00:02:00.795
Once that goes through,

00:02:00.795 --> 00:02:03.030
you just made it confirm a transaction on

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.629
your first full-stack Ethereum decentralized application.

00:02:06.629 --> 00:02:09.199
You can continue to view any of the details of

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:11.739
the contract and transactions using Etherscan.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.810
You can also read and write data about them with Web3,

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.490
similar to how you did earlier.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.615
Finally, this same process would be used to deploy to the main net.

00:02:20.615 --> 00:02:22.879
The only difference would be that you'll need to wire

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.750
everything up to the main network rather than the test network,

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.789
and the end result will cost you actual Ether.

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:31.519
While you're getting started, the test net is fine.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.365
By knowing a process like this,

00:02:33.365 --> 00:02:35.300
you can be sure that you're also be ready to

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.130
deploy to the main network when the time comes.
