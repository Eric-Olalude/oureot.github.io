00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.265
Before wrapping up this overview of new terms,

00:00:03.265 --> 00:00:09.390
let's recap an important part of ethereum known as the Ethereum Virtual Machine or EVM.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.644
The EVM is the machine that powers and runs the ethereum platform.

00:00:13.644 --> 00:00:16.989
It's often called the operating system of ethereum.

00:00:16.989 --> 00:00:21.704
It's what's responsible for running the thousands of nodes spread across the world.

00:00:21.704 --> 00:00:24.529
To do this, all nodes on the ethereum network

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.730
run the EVM as well as validating transactions.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.740
This worldwide distributed set of nodes running

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.204
the EVM is what we refer to as the world computer.

00:00:34.204 --> 00:00:39.379
Almost everything we learned about ethereum so far is possible because of the EVM.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.350
The state of ethereum blockchain is what allows us to

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.195
understand things like the account balance of each user,

00:00:45.195 --> 00:00:47.679
and it's the EVM that helps manage this.

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:52.545
The accounts we mentioned like EOAs and CAs are connected to the EVM.

00:00:52.545 --> 00:00:57.664
Also, every transaction that gets initiated goes through the EVM.

00:00:57.664 --> 00:01:00.679
Even the gas it cost to run computations is

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:04.099
calculated by the work done on the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:05.659
As the name suggests,

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.844
an Ethereum Virtual Machine is a virtual machine that executes code.

00:01:09.844 --> 00:01:13.510
Said differently, it's a runtime environment for smart contracts.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.550
In an implementation layer,

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.079
it uses a stack-based architecture.

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:22.295
There are several implementations of this already live on the main network.

00:01:22.295 --> 00:01:25.290
These are go-ethereum, Parity,

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.445
cpp-ethereum, Py-EVM, and others.

00:01:28.444 --> 00:01:30.409
These are what allow us to access

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.700
the EVM's functionality using different programming languages like Go,

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.780
C++, Python, and others.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.894
In this program, we'll be using go-ethereum.

00:01:39.894 --> 00:01:44.119
You'll learn a little more about how to get started with go- ethereum a little later.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.680
To start, Geth is a go line implementation of the ethereum protocol.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.075
It is the most common implementation used to interact with the ethereum network.

00:01:53.075 --> 00:01:55.734
We think that makes it a great place to start.

00:01:55.734 --> 00:01:58.179
But let's get back to the EVM.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.230
On top of everything else we mentioned,

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.715
it's also what allows you to run a node to build and deploy smart contracts.

00:02:04.715 --> 00:02:06.765
Once a smart contract is written,

00:02:06.765 --> 00:02:08.430
it is compiled into two views.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.995
A bytecode view that is machine-readable,

00:02:10.995 --> 00:02:13.564
and an assembly view, which is human-readable.

00:02:13.564 --> 00:02:16.930
Then this compiled code executes on the EVM,

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.724
which executes the logic of your program.

00:02:19.724 --> 00:02:22.120
As well as operating the main network,

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.900
there's also an isolated portion of the EVM used for testing.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.969
This testing ground is important for smart contracts that need

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:32.194
to verify their quality before going on to the main network.

00:02:32.194 --> 00:02:34.639
You'll be using this part of the EVM to test

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:37.393
your code when you start building smart contracts.

00:02:37.394 --> 00:02:39.705
So, that's what the EVM is,

00:02:39.705 --> 00:02:42.200
and why it's such an important part of ethereum.

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:44.209
It really is the heart of ethereum,

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.879
and is responsible for a huge part of what allows us to

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:50.609
build functional applications on the ethereum network.
