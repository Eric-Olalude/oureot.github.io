00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.685
Congratulations. You made it through the lesson,

00:00:02.685 --> 00:00:04.189
Introduction to a Ethereum.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.455
We covered a lot of ground in this lesson.

00:00:06.455 --> 00:00:09.419
Let's do a quick recap on what we learned.

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:12.775
First off, we did a refresher on blockchain framework.

00:00:12.775 --> 00:00:15.550
Then, we learned some Ethereum basic terminology,

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.660
plus the roadmap and consensus algorithm.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.810
Next, we did a bit of a compare and contrast on proof of work versus proof of stake,

00:00:23.809 --> 00:00:26.493
checked out some tools to monitor network performance,

00:00:26.493 --> 00:00:28.355
and learned how private keys,

00:00:28.355 --> 00:00:33.380
public keys, and addresses are generated during their transaction lifecycle in Ethereum.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.170
In preparation for the projects ahead of you,

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.545
you also learned how to download and install the Ethereum Command Line Interface,

00:00:40.545 --> 00:00:43.420
Ethereum Graphical User Interface, Ethereum wallet,

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.064
Minimalist wallet, and how to request for play Ether from the various forces.

00:00:48.064 --> 00:00:51.820
We even managed to create a simple transaction in the Ethereum network.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.615
Before we say our goodbyes,

00:00:53.615 --> 00:00:55.940
please join our discussion group and

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:59.034
participate in the various conversations about these topics.

00:00:59.034 --> 00:01:02.779
