00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.189
In this video, I'll show you how to get started

00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:04.710
with Web three and run some basic commands.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.679
Don't run this command yet but to install Web three,

00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:12.134
all you need to do is open a terminal and type npm install web three.

00:00:12.134 --> 00:00:14.910
That's all it takes to get it installed on your computer.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.780
But first, let's set up a project folder before getting started.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.859
So, to start, create a navigate into a project folder.

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.030
You'll use this folder to set up a small project with the Web three dependency.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:32.505
To do that, first make a directory project folder then CD into this folder.

00:00:32.505 --> 00:00:37.350
Within this directory, you'll want to initialize a project using npm in it.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.760
You can select all the defaults for now to get your package dot json file started.

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:45.424
Next, save Web three as a dependency for the project.

00:00:45.424 --> 00:00:50.119
To do this type npm install web three dash dash save.

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:53.074
This could take a little while but I want to show you the process.

00:00:53.075 --> 00:00:57.025
So, I'll speed up the camera on my end but feel free to pause it while yours installs.

00:00:57.024 --> 00:00:59.509
You'll see all types of stuff show up but if at the end it

00:00:59.509 --> 00:01:02.359
says it installed successfully, then you're good to go.

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.334
Next, open node in your terminal window by typing node.

00:01:06.334 --> 00:01:09.500
To connect to Web three from node, you'll need to require it.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.379
Make a variable named Web three with a capital W,

00:01:12.379 --> 00:01:13.609
because that's the name of

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:16.519
the main Web three class that contains all of the other modules.

00:01:16.519 --> 00:01:21.459
Then, set that equal to require Web three which is the package you installed.

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:24.199
At this point, you're connected to Web three and all

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.885
you need to do is call the web three variable you set.

00:01:26.885 --> 00:01:29.900
When you do, you should see your terminal respond with lots of

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.950
information about your installation like the version and functions it provides.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.775
One piece of information that stands out to me is the unit map.

00:01:37.775 --> 00:01:40.880
Ether is won the nomination of value in ethereum but

00:01:40.879 --> 00:01:43.609
there's many others like splitting bills into change,

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:46.655
ether can be split into many other denominations.

00:01:46.655 --> 00:01:49.549
Here you'll see everything from way together.

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.239
The most common you'll probably see other than ether is way,

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:56.420
which you've seen already if you look back at the remix contract you deployed.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.219
So, that's a lot of names but what's

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:00.905
important here is what Web three allows you to do with them.

00:02:00.905 --> 00:02:03.875
You can convert between these value types using Web three.

00:02:03.875 --> 00:02:06.920
One reason this can be important is that when sending transactions,

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.849
you can't actually specify decimal places in the amount of ether you want to send.

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.969
You will need to reduce the value to a lower denomination,

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:17.740
then specify the appropriate number of that denomination.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.725
That's confusing to explain in ether but it's easy when I relate it back to money.

00:02:22.724 --> 00:02:28.805
So, say in the US dollar version of what I mean is that you can't send $1.5 to someone.

00:02:28.805 --> 00:02:31.745
You need to convert dollars to pennies then send

00:02:31.745 --> 00:02:35.539
a 150 pennies to someone instead to avoid using a decimal place.

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:37.870
Same thing here, just with ether and way.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.500
So anyway, that's an important tip but not to relate it to Web three right now.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.944
As far as Web three goes we're already in.

00:02:44.944 --> 00:02:49.504
But there's a reason I named this concept preparing to connect to the Ethereum network.

00:02:49.504 --> 00:02:51.799
That's because Web three is the API

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.564
but we still don't have an actual connection to a network.

00:02:54.564 --> 00:02:58.099
There's a few ways to connect to the network but I wanted to connect with

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:02.090
the most impact possible using the tool that's the easiest to get set up with.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.754
So, for that reason,

00:03:03.754 --> 00:03:07.144
we're going to connect to the main network using a tool known as inferior.

00:03:07.145 --> 00:03:09.860
In the next section, we'll get you set up with inferior and

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.130
start reading data directly from the main theory in block chain.
