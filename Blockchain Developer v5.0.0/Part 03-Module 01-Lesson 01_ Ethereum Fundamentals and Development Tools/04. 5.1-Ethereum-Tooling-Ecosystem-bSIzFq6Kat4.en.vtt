00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
In this section, I'll go over some basic tools you'll

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.120
start working with as you learn more about the Ethereum network.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.185
The goal of this video, is to give you a basic introduction to each of these tools.

00:00:10.185 --> 00:00:13.350
Throughout the lesson, we'll go further into the process of downloading,

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.300
installing, and working with them.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.245
The first tool I'd like to introduce and show you, is called Etherscan.

00:00:19.245 --> 00:00:22.215
Etherscan is the Ethereum blockchain explorer.

00:00:22.215 --> 00:00:26.235
It gives you access to search the Ethereum network directly from a website.

00:00:26.235 --> 00:00:29.415
Anytime you're trying to search for details on smart contracts,

00:00:29.415 --> 00:00:31.275
accounts, or general ideas,

00:00:31.275 --> 00:00:33.300
this is a great place to start.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.375
Another important tool is called MetaMask.

00:00:36.375 --> 00:00:39.930
This browser extension brings Ethereum into your browser.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.300
Anytime you want to interact with a Dap,

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.375
you'll need to get access to the Ethereum blockchain to do that.

00:00:45.375 --> 00:00:47.650
MetaMask provides this functionality,

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.310
and helps you set up the accounts that can

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.530
interact directly with the Ethereum blockchain.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.255
Next step, is Remix.

00:00:53.255 --> 00:00:57.965
Remix is an online integrated development environment for creating smart contracts.

00:00:57.965 --> 00:00:59.570
It's really easy to get started with,

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.870
and you'll be building your first application using this tool shortly.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.885
It has a ton of great features that allow you to build, compile,

00:01:05.885 --> 00:01:09.500
deploy, and test applications from completely within the browser.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.000
While writing smart contracts is the way to write information to the blockchain,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.140
a huge part of creating applications is

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.950
being able to read information from the blockchain as well.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.310
That's done using the Ethereum JavaScript API, known as Web3.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.890
Almost anything you can find on Etherscan,

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.710
anything you see while using MetaMask,

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.900
and much more can all be done using the Web3 libraries.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.340
We'll be using this a lot to read and interact with the blockchain.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.840
Well, Web3 can give you access to the Ethereum blockchain,

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.790
it doesn't actually give you the initial connection you'll need to send and receive data.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.700
To make the actual connection, you'll need a different tool.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.560
In these lessons, will be doing that using a tool named Infura.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.120
Once in Infura, you'll be able to access

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.860
the endpoint URLs that help you make

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.515
connections and start working with the Ethereum blockchain.

00:01:54.515 --> 00:01:57.290
Infura can give you access to the live networks,

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.800
but you won't always need to connect to that network to develop applications.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.310
In some cases, it's best to use a local blockchain that you can build for yourself,

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.085
that's done using a tool known as Ganache.

00:02:08.085 --> 00:02:11.000
Ganache gives you tons of functionality that helps you build

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.895
and test applications using your own local blockchain.

00:02:13.895 --> 00:02:15.980
It's so simple to get up and running with this,

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.480
and we'll do that later in the lesson.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.290
Ganache is part of a larger suite of tools known as Truffle.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.875
Truffle gives you a lot of functionality that makes creating,

00:02:23.875 --> 00:02:26.715
deploying, and testing applications much simpler.

00:02:26.715 --> 00:02:30.260
You'll start by building smart contracts and Remix like I mentioned,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.240
but you'll eventually be bringing these tools into

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.955
Truffle because of all the added features it gives you.

00:02:34.955 --> 00:02:38.615
The final tool I wanted to introduce to you, is known as Geth.

00:02:38.615 --> 00:02:41.480
You'll hear this come up a lot when talking about Ethereum,

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.970
but I actually won't be getting to it until a little bit later.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.855
Geth allows you to set up a local Ethereum node on your own computer.

00:02:47.855 --> 00:02:49.550
While this can be really helpful,

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.860
it works similar to a Bitcoin node and that you need to

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.355
download the entire blockchain to your own computer to get set up.

00:02:55.355 --> 00:02:57.605
While it does provide great functionality

00:02:57.605 --> 00:02:59.660
and I would say you should get setup eventually,

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.090
I'll be leaning on using a tool like Infura to connect

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.640
you to the blockchain without needing to download it for yourself.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.320
So, there's a quick overview of

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.860
the tools we'll be working with throughout the upcoming lessons.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.795
Don't worry if you're not completely sure how this all fits together.

00:03:11.795 --> 00:03:14.150
I'll be going into a lot more detail about each of

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.940
them as they become important for your development environment.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.360
I'll start with the tools that are quickest and easiest to get started with,

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.450
and work towards those that take a little more effort to get up and running.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.250
Each of these tools can integrate with others in different ways,

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.075
and I'll try to highlight as many useful features as I can.

00:03:29.075 --> 00:03:31.290
It's a lot of tools but they're so helpful,

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.810
and I think that you'll be happy that you get

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.760
the opportunity to work with them so quickly.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.995
So, coming up, we'll dive into some of these tools

00:03:36.995 --> 00:03:39.730
and start exploring the Ethereum blockchain for ourselves.
