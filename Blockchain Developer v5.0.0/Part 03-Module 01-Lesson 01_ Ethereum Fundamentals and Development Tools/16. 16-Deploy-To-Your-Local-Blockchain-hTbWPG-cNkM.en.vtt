00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
Let's take a look back at the first step we created to set and get a message.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.120
Using our new tools,

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.345
we can add a lot of functionality to this and help bring everything together.

00:00:09.345 --> 00:00:12.660
In this video, we'll deploy our contract to our local blockchain,

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.600
make a few transactions to see them log into the blockchain,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.855
then read some of the information using Web3 from the code editor.

00:00:18.855 --> 00:00:23.280
To do this, I've got Ganache open and my code editor with the connection setup.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.010
I have one command written out to get the transaction count,

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.480
and I'll show you this in a minute.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.910
To start, go back to Remix.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.370
The contract you wrote before should still be saved there.

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.585
If not, you can copy the code from below the video or type in what you see here.

00:00:36.585 --> 00:00:38.475
We'll deploy this contract now.

00:00:38.475 --> 00:00:42.225
Like before, compile the contract to make sure Remix is happy with it.

00:00:42.225 --> 00:00:44.210
Next, go to the Run tab.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.760
What we'll do now is a little different than before.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.640
Instead of deploying to the JavaScript VM environment,

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.820
select Web3 Provider from the choices shown.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.165
It'll ask if you're sure you want to connect to an Ethereum node.

00:00:56.165 --> 00:00:59.260
I'm pretty sure I want to do that, so I'll hit Okay.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.060
From there, you can choose where you want to connect.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.665
It defaults to your Ganache CLI at 8545.

00:01:05.665 --> 00:01:07.610
Normally, I'd say choose what you want,

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.170
but for now it'll be a lot easier to

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.440
demonstrate what's happening if you change this to 7545,

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.945
the graphic user interface.

00:01:13.945 --> 00:01:15.930
So, I'll change that now.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.535
Once you do that, you're all set up.

00:01:18.535 --> 00:01:20.880
Next, we'll deploy the contract.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.565
Over in Ganache, you'll see that this shows up as a contract creation under transactions.

00:01:25.565 --> 00:01:28.955
It's also in the logs and blocks if you want to check that out, too.

00:01:28.955 --> 00:01:30.800
Another important thing to note is that

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.665
the transaction has been assigned to a specific account.

00:01:33.665 --> 00:01:36.980
That account is coming from what was designated in Remix.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.360
If you go back to Remix,

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.210
you can see which account this was.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.760
It looks like it was the first account and that you also have the option to select

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.525
from any of the accounts that provided by the connection to your local blockchain.

00:01:47.525 --> 00:01:49.310
These showed up when you first connect to them,

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.400
and you can switch between them however you like.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.895
Also notice that the account that deployed the contract isn't at 100 Ether anymore.

00:01:55.895 --> 00:02:00.275
The gas cost was taken out for creating the transaction that deployed the contract.

00:02:00.275 --> 00:02:03.545
From here, you can start getting and setting messages however you like.

00:02:03.545 --> 00:02:05.545
I'll say, "Hey local blockchain."

00:02:05.545 --> 00:02:08.145
All of these will show up in the Remix terminal,

00:02:08.145 --> 00:02:10.155
and they'll also show up in Ganache.

00:02:10.155 --> 00:02:11.860
For each transaction you make,

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.795
the transaction count for that account will continue to increment.

00:02:14.795 --> 00:02:16.790
That's where the code editor comes in.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.870
Like before, you can call any of the information on these accounts using Web3.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.880
That's what this last line does here.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.145
We've seen getTransactionCount before,

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:28.350
and this is just running it on the first account I have on my blockchain.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.555
Update this line to include your account address and run the file to see the value.

00:02:32.555 --> 00:02:35.300
This should match what it shows over in Ganache.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.950
You've got a lot of fun new tools connected,

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.600
and you keep getting and setting messages to your heart's content.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.335
Then try reading different types of data using Web3.

00:02:42.335 --> 00:02:43.910
Like I mentioned earlier in the lesson,

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.225
this is still a very simple contract but it helps get the point across.

00:02:47.225 --> 00:02:50.690
Later on, you'll be making much more complicated contracts using Solidity,

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.530
but you'll still use tools like this in the same way to help develop and test them.
