00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.109
Over the next few sections,

00:00:02.109 --> 00:00:05.759
we'll walk through some terms that are new and some that might be familiar already.

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.699
We'll take some time to walk through how each of them relates to the Ethereum protocol.

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:15.494
In this video, we'll start that discussion by exploring the state of a blockchain.

00:00:15.494 --> 00:00:17.419
This term hasn't come up much yet,

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.120
so we'll first define what we mean by state.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.505
From there, we'll compare how state is handled in Bitcoin versus Ethereum.

00:00:24.504 --> 00:00:30.049
How a blockchain manages information within its data storage layer determines its state.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.679
It's defined by variables,

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.924
like how the protocol handles transactions,

00:00:33.924 --> 00:00:36.759
keys, fees and other information.

00:00:36.759 --> 00:00:39.945
In Bitcoin, unspent transaction outputs or

00:00:39.945 --> 00:00:43.814
UTXOs are what represent the state of the blockchain.

00:00:43.814 --> 00:00:47.284
You can use this state to figure out other information.

00:00:47.284 --> 00:00:49.619
For example, you can use the sum of

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:53.974
these UTXOs to find the number of Bitcoins owned by a user.

00:00:53.975 --> 00:00:56.570
What's interesting in Bitcoin is that it doesn't

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.210
have a way to represent an account balance.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.984
That information isn't held anywhere.

00:01:01.984 --> 00:01:04.879
It's found by referring to the state of the blockchain.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.164
But it isn't an actual number you can find in the records.

00:01:08.165 --> 00:01:11.525
Instead, the account balance of a user is the sum of

00:01:11.525 --> 00:01:15.195
each UTXO owned by the users of a private key.

00:01:15.194 --> 00:01:18.434
That's different from Ethereum in a few important ways.

00:01:18.435 --> 00:01:23.870
For one, the Ethereum state can manage much more than unspent transaction outputs.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.585
Ethereum can hold these account balances.

00:01:26.584 --> 00:01:27.919
On top of that,

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.085
it holds a few other fields like the Nonce, Balance,

00:01:31.084 --> 00:01:32.964
Storage Hash, Code Hash,

00:01:32.965 --> 00:01:35.920
Account Storage and Ethereum Virtual Code.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.019
This state holds a list of all accounts and creates

00:01:39.019 --> 00:01:42.054
a mapping between an address and an account State.

00:01:42.055 --> 00:01:43.870
This might be a little vague right now.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:49.045
And that's because it's actually a brand new conceptual idea. Here's what that means.

00:01:49.045 --> 00:01:52.585
Where in Bitcoin all information stays on the blockchain,

00:01:52.584 --> 00:01:55.034
Ethereum does this a little different.

00:01:55.034 --> 00:01:57.819
In Ethereum, the account state is separate.

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:59.750
It is removed from the blockchain,

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.890
but holds information about the state of the blockchain.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.129
The blockchain is still the ledger that maintains the history of transactions.

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:09.689
This other information including accounts,

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:13.359
addresses, and balances exists along with this state.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.350
Ethereum maps this information to the blockchain

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.699
allowing it to track things like the account balance of user.

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:23.530
This is possible because of something known as a Patricia tree.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.060
Trees are common data structures and you may be

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.009
familiar with ones like binary trees or heaps.

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:30.929
Patricia is an acronym.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.875
It stands for practical algorithm to retrieve

00:02:33.875 --> 00:02:37.889
information coded in alphanumeric. That's a mouthful.

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:40.549
And without diving too far into the details,

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.530
the main benefit of this structure relates to storage.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.789
It allows Ethereum to store values in a way that expands

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:50.340
the state to include the account values we mentioned earlier.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.490
That wraps up a quick overview of

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.195
blockchain state and how it differs between Bitcoin and Ethereum.

00:02:56.194 --> 00:02:59.224
Coming up, we'll look at how these states are determined

00:02:59.224 --> 00:03:02.719
by looking at account types on the Ethereum platform.
