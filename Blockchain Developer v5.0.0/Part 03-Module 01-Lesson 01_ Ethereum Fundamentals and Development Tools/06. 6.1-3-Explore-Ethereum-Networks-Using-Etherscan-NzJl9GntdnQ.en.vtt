00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.129
At this point, we're ready to jump in and start exploring the Ethereum network.

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:08.445
The simplest way to do that is with a tool called Etherscan.

00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:11.849
There's a ton of information here and it can be a little overwhelming at first.

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.000
In this video, I'll try and focus on a few of the main ideas,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.565
then set you off to continue exploring for yourself.

00:00:17.565 --> 00:00:19.500
To start, on this homepage,

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.679
you'll get a general overview of what's going on with the Ethereum network.

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:24.179
At the top, it shows some of

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:27.285
the market information and the transaction history over time.

00:00:27.285 --> 00:00:29.640
A little further down, you can see all the blocks and

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.685
transactions updating live as they happen on the network.

00:00:32.685 --> 00:00:35.460
You can click on these to view more of the details if you'd like.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.939
For example, I'll click on this transaction.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.289
From this page, we can see the transaction hash,

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:43.969
status, who it was from,

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:46.174
who it was sent to, and more.

00:00:46.174 --> 00:00:48.679
You can also click on one of the accounts to see

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:52.414
more specific details about that account. I'll try this one.

00:00:52.414 --> 00:00:54.920
Once you're here, you're looking at an account overview of

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.829
what any account page on the Ethereum network would look like.

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:59.659
Here's the balance of the user,

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:01.159
the number of transactions they've made,

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:03.064
and a list of all these transactions.

00:01:03.064 --> 00:01:04.939
If you click on one of the transactions,

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.629
you'll see you're just back at the transaction overview like we were before.

00:01:08.629 --> 00:01:10.819
Rather than searching around by clicking,

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:13.444
you can also go up to the search bar to search by address,

00:01:13.444 --> 00:01:15.964
transaction hash, blocks or anything else.

00:01:15.965 --> 00:01:19.204
This will become more important when we actually have our own data to work with,

00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:21.620
but for now, I'll keep clicking around.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.865
On the top table, you'll see the home,

00:01:23.864 --> 00:01:26.674
blockchain, tokens, resources and more.

00:01:26.674 --> 00:01:29.420
I encourage you to click around and try all these out,

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.105
but to start, I wanted to focus on two main things.

00:01:32.105 --> 00:01:34.760
Specifically, I want to look at the top accounts and

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.775
some of the tokens so that we can see some contract information.

00:01:37.775 --> 00:01:40.950
To start, I'll click top accounts.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.495
Here, you'll see a list of all the riches of Ethereum owners listed in order.

00:01:46.495 --> 00:01:49.400
As you can see, we don't actually know who these account owners are,

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.230
that part isn't made available to us.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.560
But we can see any information we need about the accounts themselves.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.090
It looks like the top account currently has over 1.5 million Ether,

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.710
and it has made over two thousand transactions.

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:04.140
Click any of these accounts to get back to an account overview page.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.625
The other type of account that you'll learn more about is a contract account.

00:02:07.625 --> 00:02:12.115
These are accounts not for users but for the smart contracts who deploy to the network.

00:02:12.115 --> 00:02:16.939
By going here, you can see all the verified contracts that exist on the Ethereum network.

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:20.900
You can navigate through this to see all the details provided about the contracts,

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.719
but I actually prefer to start by looking at the top tokens.

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:25.569
You can get there by going here.

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.349
This is where you'll be able to find some of

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:29.989
the more well-known contracts that you can explore.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.810
As an example, you may have heard of binance.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.284
Binance is an exchange for Cryptocurrency,

00:02:35.284 --> 00:02:39.424
and Cryptocurrency is the name for currencies that exist across different networks.

00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:42.510
In Ethereum's case, their Cryptocurrency is called Ether.

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:45.935
And you'll be working with this a lot as you get more involved with the Ethereum.

00:02:45.935 --> 00:02:49.030
You can click here to view all the information about binance.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.544
The same as you can view any other type of account.

00:02:51.544 --> 00:02:54.334
Things like the total number of their currency that exists.

00:02:54.335 --> 00:02:57.080
How many people hold their coin, their official site,

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.425
and all of the transactions that have taken place can be seen from here.

00:03:00.425 --> 00:03:03.155
From this page, you can get a hold of their contract,

00:03:03.155 --> 00:03:04.745
which is what I'm really looking for.

00:03:04.745 --> 00:03:07.844
To get there, go over to contract and click here.

00:03:07.844 --> 00:03:09.439
Once in here, you can find

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:12.109
even more information and feel free to explore it for yourself.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.795
But right now, what I'm interested in, is the code.

00:03:14.794 --> 00:03:17.704
This contract code shown here uses solidity,

00:03:17.705 --> 00:03:19.745
like what you deployed earlier in the lesson.

00:03:19.745 --> 00:03:22.335
Underneath this, is the contract ABI,

00:03:22.335 --> 00:03:24.230
which is a binary representation of

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:26.780
the smart contract that you'll need to interact with it.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.849
Below, is a few more details that we don't need to worry about quite yet.

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:35.900
Finally, everything we've looked at so far is specific to the Ethereum main network.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.360
There are also other networks that exist for testing,

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.590
and you can view all of the same information about each of those networks too.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.664
By going over to more,

00:03:44.664 --> 00:03:46.344
you can see tons of information,

00:03:46.344 --> 00:03:49.414
but for other explorers is where I wanted to focus now.

00:03:49.414 --> 00:03:53.359
The three tests networks are named Ropsten, Rinkeby and Kovan.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.270
I heard they're named after places in London, but I'm not totally sure.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.300
Either way, these are the test networks that you'll be deploying to later on,

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.490
and we'll learn more about them as we move forward.

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.685
So, that's what I wanted to show you about Etherscan.

00:04:04.685 --> 00:04:07.729
We'll be coming back to this a lot to check on important details of

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:11.729
the network accounts and transactions on the Ethereum networks.
