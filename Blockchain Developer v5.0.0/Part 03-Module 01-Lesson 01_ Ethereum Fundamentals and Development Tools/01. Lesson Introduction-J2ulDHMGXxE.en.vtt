00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.174
Hi, and welcome to the lesson.

00:00:02.174 --> 00:00:05.109
In this lesson, we'll go over the basics of Ethereum.

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:09.050
I'm PK, and I'll be your instructor for this and the next few lessons.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.035
You haven't seen much of me yet, but Brandy, Elena,

00:00:12.035 --> 00:00:14.160
and I had been behind the scenes building

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.030
the projects you have been completing throughout the program.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.230
As well as working with Udacity,

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.285
I've funded to blockchain startups.

00:00:21.285 --> 00:00:23.219
At my most recent startup, LINCD,

00:00:23.219 --> 00:00:27.379
we specialize in blockchain strategy and distributed ledger infrastructure.

00:00:27.379 --> 00:00:32.195
Our focus is helping companies understand how do blockchain enable their business.

00:00:32.195 --> 00:00:33.570
On a daily basis,

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.868
I work on a variety of blockchain technologies,

00:00:35.868 --> 00:00:38.240
including Ethereum and I will bring

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.719
that hands-on knowledge to teach you how to get started for yourself.

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:43.914
Throughout the lesson, you'll hear from me,

00:00:43.914 --> 00:00:46.350
and also learn some new concepts from Joe.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.385
An instructor you're probably familiar with from earlier in the program.

00:00:50.384 --> 00:00:53.445
Earlier, you learned how the Bitcoin blockchain works.

00:00:53.445 --> 00:00:57.810
Throughout this course, we'll use these ideas to introduce the Ethereum blockchain.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.234
You get up and running with Ethereum's tools,

00:01:00.234 --> 00:01:02.755
developer ecosystem, and protocol.

00:01:02.755 --> 00:01:07.579
Ethereum is a completely separate blockchain platform from what we've gone over so far.

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:09.719
We'll start off by introducing its purpose,

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:11.780
along with some basic terminology.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.504
By the end of this lesson, you'll start using some of these tools for yourself.

00:01:15.504 --> 00:01:17.929
The goal is to make sure you're prepared to develop

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.775
more complex applications using Ethereum.

00:01:20.775 --> 00:01:23.660
You'll also get to know the supply side of Eata,

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.524
the various consensus algorithms available to us,

00:01:26.525 --> 00:01:29.445
current performance of the Ethereum network, scaling plans,

00:01:29.444 --> 00:01:33.289
and also understand topics such as accounts, transactions,

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.635
gas, fees, network types,

00:01:35.635 --> 00:01:38.130
and the Ethereum, which we'll mention itself.

00:01:38.129 --> 00:01:40.909
I am really excited to teach you these topics,

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.599
and can't wait to show you a Ethereum through a dev lens.
