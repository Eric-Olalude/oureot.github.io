00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
Hopefully now, you're excited to get started with Truffle.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.439
Getting started is easy,

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.230
and it's a great way to improve your developer experience.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.699
In this video, I'll walk through the setup and some basic functionality it provides.

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:15.660
To start, head to the Truffle documentation to see how to install it.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.850
From your terminal, all you need to do is type npm install truffle -g,

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.040
and your installation will start.

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.049
Once it started, you can set up

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.230
a project folder similar to how you would for other projects.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.149
First, make a directory.

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:32.489
Now, change into that directory.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.355
To initialize a Truffle project, type truffle init.

00:00:36.354 --> 00:00:39.634
This will start building out the environment that you'll be building in.

00:00:39.634 --> 00:00:42.019
It can take a minute, but once it's done,

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.940
you're all set to start building.

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:47.390
Open this up in your code editor to see what you got.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.329
On the left panel, you'll see a contracts folder,

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:52.799
a migrations folder, and a test folder.

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:54.949
What Truffle is doing is allowing you to build

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.530
contracts from directly within your code editor.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.750
It compiles, migrates, and deploys

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.329
these contracts whenever you run the commands to do this.

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.209
We'll go over those in a minute.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:06.734
If you click on migrations.sol,

00:01:06.734 --> 00:01:10.084
you'll see a smart contract already written out as an example.

00:01:10.084 --> 00:01:15.049
Under migrations, you'll see a file that's responsible for migrating your smart contract.

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:20.045
In this case, migrating is similar to copying the ABI like you did in Remix.

00:01:20.045 --> 00:01:22.040
When you migrate your contract,

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.290
you'll see a new file come up that includes the ABI

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.545
for you without you needing to copy and paste it every time.

00:01:27.545 --> 00:01:30.454
Below that is the configuration files.

00:01:30.454 --> 00:01:34.234
If you're on Windows, you'll want to look at truffle-config.js,

00:01:34.234 --> 00:01:37.069
and if you're on a Mac, you'll want to use truffle.js.

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:39.664
Either way, these both do the same thing.

00:01:39.665 --> 00:01:43.265
The config file is how you'll set up your network connections.

00:01:43.265 --> 00:01:46.250
Once in the file, look at modules.exports.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.010
Here, you'll see a link to the configuration details.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.825
Follow that to see the latest version of these files from the Truffle website.

00:01:52.825 --> 00:01:55.549
Grab that code and paste it into your editor.

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.355
By default, they're setting you up with the Ganache CLI,

00:01:58.355 --> 00:02:00.829
but you can change that if you're using something else.

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:04.344
This is where you put your connection to other things like Infura.

00:02:04.344 --> 00:02:06.239
Once you've made this connection,

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:09.680
you're connected to the blockchain and are ready to start building and testing.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.230
For that, go back to your terminal.

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:16.069
In the terminal, you can view the commands available to you by typing truffle.

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.449
Check this out if you'd like,

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:21.084
but I'll focus on the ones that helped me compile and migrate my contract.

00:02:21.085 --> 00:02:25.640
To do that, I can use the terminal to type truffle followed by the commands they provide.

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:29.679
Or I can log into the Truffle console and just type the name of the command.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.849
I'll log into the Truffle console.

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.030
To do that, type truffle console to get started.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.530
Once I'm here, I can compile and migrate my contracts. It's simple.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.705
First, run the command compile.

00:02:41.705 --> 00:02:45.525
Next, run the command migrate, and that's it.

00:02:45.525 --> 00:02:48.034
You just compiled and migrated your contract.

00:02:48.034 --> 00:02:50.719
This took care of a lot of the tedious work for you.

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:52.759
No more copying and pasting.

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:56.329
Back in the project, you'll see they created a new folder for you.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.255
This folder includes the contract migration files.

00:02:59.254 --> 00:03:01.655
If you look at the migrations.json file,

00:03:01.655 --> 00:03:05.090
you'll see that's just the ABI of the contract that has been made for you.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.969
It's that ABI plus all the other information you could

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:10.870
view from Remix when you click more details on your contract.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.800
For an example of where to go from here,

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.830
let's make another contract file myMessage.sol.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.520
In that file, I'll paste the contract we've been working on already.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.300
We now have our contract set up,

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.180
so let's go back to the terminal.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.645
From the terminal, we'll do the same thing again.

00:03:25.645 --> 00:03:29.719
Type compile. Next, run the command migrate.

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:32.030
By doing that, you just got a whole new contract

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.444
compiled and migrated over to your build folder.

00:03:34.444 --> 00:03:37.039
Head back to the project to see for yourself.

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:39.280
There it is. All right.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.840
So, there's the basics of getting up and running with Truffle.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.370
This is an excellent tool that can work

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.800
alongside a lot of the other tools you already know.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.955
It helps abstract away a good chunk of the tedious work you'd be doing otherwise.

00:03:49.955 --> 00:03:51.620
As you progress through the program,

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.405
you'll see a lot more about how this can provide

00:03:53.405 --> 00:03:57.069
even more functionality for things like testing and deploying your contracts.
