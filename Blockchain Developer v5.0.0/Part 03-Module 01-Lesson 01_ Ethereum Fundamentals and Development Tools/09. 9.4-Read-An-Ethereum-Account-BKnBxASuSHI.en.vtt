00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.950
All right. So, you're finally connected to

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:04.995
the Ethereum main network with Infura and Web3.

00:00:04.995 --> 00:00:08.339
In this video, I want to show you how you can read data directly from

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:12.009
your terminal that used to only be available to you from Etherscan.

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:16.689
First, I'll navigate to Etherscan and select an address.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.394
Next, I'll set a variable named address equal to that address.

00:00:25.394 --> 00:00:28.530
Now, all I need to do is write a line that returns

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.070
the balance of the address and sets it to a variable named balance.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.185
I pasted this in from the documentation,

00:00:34.185 --> 00:00:37.150
but let's run it first to see what it returns.

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.894
Great, we now have the balance of this account.

00:00:40.895 --> 00:00:45.125
You can check Etherscan to see if this is correct. It looks right to me.

00:00:45.125 --> 00:00:48.500
One difference you'll notice is that our balance is listed in Wei,

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.899
but the balance on Etherscan is in Ether.

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.719
If you want to view the balance in Wei in your terminal,

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:55.850
then you'll need to make the conversion yourself.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.045
This can be done using the web3.utils module.

00:00:59.045 --> 00:01:01.219
For now, I'll leave it as a challenge to you,

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:02.284
and in the next concept,

00:01:02.284 --> 00:01:04.075
I'll show you a way to do it.

00:01:04.075 --> 00:01:07.534
For now, you might be wondering what this code even means.

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:10.709
There's a couple of things to note here when you're first getting started.

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:15.894
First, the balance function exists within the Eth module along with many other functions.

00:01:15.894 --> 00:01:21.229
You can check out the web3.eth module documentation to learn more about these functions.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.460
Next, in this piece of code,

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:26.750
we're passing in the address URL that we set above.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.775
Finally, since blockchain calls are asynchronous,

00:01:29.775 --> 00:01:31.660
we're ending with a callback function.

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.429
This callback function sets the value of our balance to a variable named balance.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.975
Once this is all set up,

00:01:37.974 --> 00:01:42.369
we can call the variable balance and that's what's returning the balance of the account.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.000
This is a common pattern you'll see in the calls you make using Web3.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.560
It can be a bit strange to get used to,

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.170
but once you start seeing it a lot, it's not so bad.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.995
If you forget what to do, you can always refer back to the documentation.

00:01:53.995 --> 00:01:57.010
I put a link below the video that takes you to this exact line of

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.385
code in the documentation along with some extra description.

00:02:00.385 --> 00:02:03.590
You can read through this for some more explanation of how this works.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.730
Then, when you're ready, before moving on,

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.469
try reading the balance of a few different accounts to help you get the hang of it.
