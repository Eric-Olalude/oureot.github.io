00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.615
In this section, we will go over some topics related to the Ethereum network performance,

00:00:05.615 --> 00:00:10.379
and how to use a tool called Ethstats to look into some of the network metrics.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.640
First, it's important to understand

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.635
a few basic definitions and how they relate to the Ethereum network performance.

00:00:16.635 --> 00:00:19.385
To do this, we will be at this URL,

00:00:19.385 --> 00:00:22.620
ethstats.net, walking through a dashboard.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.160
If you'd like to follow along,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.844
I'll have enclosed the link below the video.

00:00:27.844 --> 00:00:33.045
So, let's begin exploring the dashboard from the top left hand corner.

00:00:33.045 --> 00:00:36.219
The numbers you see on your dashboard when you explore

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:40.554
might be slightly different to what you hear in this recording.

00:00:40.554 --> 00:00:46.494
Best Block. It is the highest block number of the longest valid chains,

00:00:46.494 --> 00:00:50.274
said differently, it is heavy with current difficulty.

00:00:50.274 --> 00:00:54.320
Uncles or orphan blocks,

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.640
and unlike other blockchains in ethereum,

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.710
they are included and rewarded.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.045
The dashboard displays the current block uncle count,

00:01:04.045 --> 00:01:07.070
and that from the last 50 blocks.

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:10.744
Last block is the time since the last mine block.

00:01:10.745 --> 00:01:12.795
It's in seconds.

00:01:12.795 --> 00:01:19.234
Average block time is the average time between two blocks, excluding uncles.

00:01:19.234 --> 00:01:21.859
It should display something in 15 seconds.

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:26.650
But right now it shows closer to zero seconds.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.250
Let's browse to the right.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.200
Okay. Average network hash rate

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.975
is the number of hashes spent by miners to find a new block.

00:01:38.974 --> 00:01:44.064
Typically, this is shown in tera hashes.

00:01:44.064 --> 00:01:47.019
So currently this particular dashboard is not synched,

00:01:47.019 --> 00:01:50.739
so it's probably showing you zero kilo kilohash.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:58.700
Difficulty is also known as the mining difficulty to find a new block.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.019
Let's look at the next row, the bottom side.

00:02:02.019 --> 00:02:06.949
Average nodes or active nodes is just the number of nodes connected to the

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.629
dashboard.The total number of active connected nodes powering the network is quite high.

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.254
So right now you see 15 nodes are active. Yes.

00:02:16.254 --> 00:02:18.430
Next one is gas price.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.980
That's the price the miners are currently accepting.

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:26.114
Currently it's at six or 7.5 gwei,

00:02:26.115 --> 00:02:31.110
which is 60 gigawei,

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:38.910
which is 6 billion rei.

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:42.829
So, the default is 20. The.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.125
Next one is gas limit.

00:02:45.125 --> 00:02:48.719
Gas limit is the gas limit for a block.

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:53.560
The dashboard reads 8,000,029.

00:02:55.009 --> 00:03:01.754
And the miner can include transactions until the block is full and limit is met.

00:03:01.754 --> 00:03:06.264
The default is formally in 712388,

00:03:06.264 --> 00:03:09.294
which is 1.5 pound million gas.

00:03:09.294 --> 00:03:13.339
In bitcoin, you might have come across block size limit.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.145
So this is quite similar.

00:03:15.145 --> 00:03:17.189
So let's look at the next one.

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:19.169
Page latency.

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:22.614
It takes 130 milliseconds,

00:03:22.615 --> 00:03:24.400
which is the dashboard stat.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.830
Uptime is also a dashboard stat.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.120
And then you'll see a map in here.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.134
It's a global map where all these nodes that are connecting into the dashboard.

00:03:36.134 --> 00:03:40.965
It's just a dot represents which ones are connected to these dashboards right now.

00:03:40.965 --> 00:03:42.900
Okay, let's let's look at the next one,

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.439
which is block time.

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:49.724
In my dashboard it's not currently showing up.

00:03:49.724 --> 00:03:53.574
But currently, it maps out to the actual time between blocks.

00:03:53.574 --> 00:03:56.354
So we looked at- it's less than zero seconds,

00:03:56.354 --> 00:03:58.414
so that's probably why it's not showing up.

00:03:58.414 --> 00:04:00.590
Difficulty chart.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.310
That maps the actual difficulty of previous blocks.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.074
The next one is block propagation chart.

00:04:08.074 --> 00:04:10.834
That's for the nodes connected to the dashboard.

00:04:10.835 --> 00:04:15.730
It is how fast the blocks are shared or propagated between nodes.

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:18.795
The last block mines displays the public key

00:04:18.795 --> 00:04:23.884
of the miners who found the most number of blocks.

00:04:23.884 --> 00:04:25.550
Right? Okay.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:26.750
We went through the maps,

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:32.384
so let's come back to the next row which is uncle count chart.

00:04:32.384 --> 00:04:34.789
It's got a green and blues in here.

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.720
The uncle count chart displays the number of uncles per 25 blocks per bar.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.090
So each bar is five uncles per 25 blocks.

00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:48.009
Next one is transactions.

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:51.995
That displays the number of transactions included in the previous blocks.

00:04:51.995 --> 00:04:54.230
The gas spending chart would show you

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.600
something that's correlated to the transaction charts,

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.930
and it displays the amount of spent gas.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.100
The gas limit chart over here is dynamic

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.425
in nature and it shows gas limit for the previous blocks.

00:05:07.425 --> 00:05:12.470
Please note, this dashboard does not represent the entire state of the Ethereum network,

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.965
but it gives you a very good handle on what's happening.

00:05:15.964 --> 00:05:17.250
Should you choose to,

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.670
you can volunteer to connect to your node,

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:22.405
to the dashboard for which you need to run

00:05:22.404 --> 00:05:26.469
an Ethereum node in your machine or in a cloud.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:34.050
The next set of rows over here that you see are basically in tabular format.

00:05:35.519 --> 00:05:38.673
So feel free to spend some time here,

00:05:38.673 --> 00:05:40.639
get to know the dashboard well and how

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:44.680
the various numbers change as the network continues to perform.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.814
Okay, so let's wrap this up.

00:05:46.814 --> 00:05:49.819
In this lesson we've covered the Ethereum network performance,

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:53.230
dove into some of the metrics in how to inspect it.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:57.850
This tool and metrics will come handy when you start building your projects.

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:59.390
In the next lesson,

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:03.279
we will cover how transaction life cycle works in Ethereum.
