00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.409
To work with a Ethereum,

00:00:01.409 --> 00:00:05.459
you're going to need an API that can make calls to and from the blockchain.

00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:08.129
That's exactly what Web3 can do for you,

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.520
and in this section, I'll give you some quick tips for getting started.

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.490
Later in this concept, I'll run through the installation and

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.774
setup you'll need to go through to get up and running for yourself.

00:00:17.774 --> 00:00:20.604
One note about how powerful Web3 is,

00:00:20.605 --> 00:00:22.289
is that you've actually used it already,

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.804
maybe without realizing it.

00:00:23.804 --> 00:00:26.699
MetaMask runs entirely based off this ability

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.714
to inject a Web3 Provider into your browser.

00:00:29.714 --> 00:00:32.475
Once MetaMask injects this Web3 Provider,

00:00:32.475 --> 00:00:36.115
it uses Web3 to connect users to the Ethereum blockchain.

00:00:36.115 --> 00:00:39.885
So, that's one example use case but there's so many others.

00:00:39.884 --> 00:00:43.670
I just wanted to mention that the tool MetaMask that you now know as one of

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.039
the single most important connections between DApps and

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:49.250
their users is only possible because of Web3.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.344
Hopefully that puts into perspective how useful this tool can be for you.

00:00:53.344 --> 00:00:57.994
So, let's look a little bit at the resources available to get you started with Web3.

00:00:57.994 --> 00:01:00.104
First, on their Docs homepage,

00:01:00.104 --> 00:01:03.259
you can see that web3.js is a collection of libraries,

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:06.530
which allow you to interact with a local or remote Ethereum node.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.504
This is done using either an HTTP or IPC connection.

00:01:10.504 --> 00:01:12.649
In our case, we'll use it to interact with

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.505
remote and local Ethereum nodes using an HTTP connection.

00:01:16.504 --> 00:01:19.489
From this page, you can learn more about getting started and

00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:22.174
take a first look at some of the functionality it provides.

00:01:22.174 --> 00:01:23.659
There's a ton of modules here,

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.179
and there's no reason to know all of them right away.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.120
We'll focus on introducing them as they become relevant to our projects,

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.435
and you can continue exploring them later as you need more functionality.

00:01:32.435 --> 00:01:37.540
Another great resource for getting started is the web3-js Ethereum Community Forums.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.170
This forums dedicated to discussions related to

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.995
Web3 and could provide you with some valuable information.

00:01:42.995 --> 00:01:45.590
Another option for forums is to turn back to

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.270
the Ethereum Gitter page for the room named web3.js.

00:01:49.269 --> 00:01:52.459
Finally, there's the Ethereum JavaScript API wiki,

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:55.294
which is dedicated to getting you up and running with Web3.

00:01:55.295 --> 00:01:58.189
I've put all these links down below the video so you can check them out

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.284
for yourselves as you learn more about Web3 in the lesson.

00:02:01.284 --> 00:02:04.564
So, there some of the details behind why Web3 is important,

00:02:04.564 --> 00:02:07.204
how it's used, and where you can go for some more information.

00:02:07.204 --> 00:02:09.530
Coming up, we'll jump right in and get it installed on

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.669
your computer to start running your first Web3 commands.
