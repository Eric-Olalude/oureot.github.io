00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
Throughout the lesson, the term gas and fees keeps coming

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.315
up and you finally just got an overview of what we're talking about.

00:00:06.315 --> 00:00:08.280
You might be saying, "Joe,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.440
why didn't you just explain this to me sooner?"

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.790
Well, maybe I could have,

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.030
but I didn't because I wanted you to be able to see the gas and fees

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.645
for yourself by making a transaction and viewing the results.

00:00:18.645 --> 00:00:21.085
At this point, you've made those transactions,

00:00:21.085 --> 00:00:23.630
so it will be easy to see what happens with the gas.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.600
So now, go back to the transaction you made earlier,

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.315
create a new one, or just watch what I'm doing on screen.

00:00:29.315 --> 00:00:31.235
What you'll see is that the difference in

00:00:31.235 --> 00:00:34.505
each account isn't exactly equal to the amount you sent.

00:00:34.505 --> 00:00:37.400
The sender has a little more taken out of their account.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.055
That's because of the cost of gas.

00:00:40.055 --> 00:00:43.490
The gas cost is always taken from the sender's address.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.860
What you can do to verify this is take the amount

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.425
that's left in the sender's account and add the gas to it.

00:00:48.425 --> 00:00:51.170
What you'll see is that this evens out and leaves you with what

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.125
should be the correct balance of the sender. So, that's it.

00:00:54.125 --> 00:00:56.990
Every time you make a transaction on the Ethereum network,

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.090
you'll see that the account balance decreases more than exactly what you specified.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.170
That's because of the cost of running the transaction on the network,

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.230
and you can verify the difference by adding

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.665
the total cost of gas back to the account balance that's remaining.

00:01:09.665 --> 00:01:13.475
This gas cost is a big reason that using Ganache makes so much sense.

00:01:13.475 --> 00:01:15.890
Otherwise, you could practice making transactions on

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.380
the main and test network with not much of a problem.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.410
But since it cost gas to make each transaction,

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.590
you'll eventually drain your account of its funds.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.290
In the test network, you need to go through the hassle of getting more test Ether,

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.825
and in the main account, you just lost a lot of money.

00:01:29.825 --> 00:01:31.880
So, try making some transactions,

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.005
check out the gas costs,

00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:35.600
and keep it in mind when you're making transactions in the future.
