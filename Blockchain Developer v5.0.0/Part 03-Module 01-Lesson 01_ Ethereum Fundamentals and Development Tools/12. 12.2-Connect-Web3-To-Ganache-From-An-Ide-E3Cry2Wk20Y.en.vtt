00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.070
The terminal isn't always

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.505
the most convenient place to run commands when you're working on larger projects.

00:00:05.505 --> 00:00:07.830
For that reason, it's usually best to be able to connect to

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.605
our tools using your IDE or code editor.

00:00:10.605 --> 00:00:13.270
Setting this up is pretty similar to what we did before,

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.015
so we can run through this pretty quickly.

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:17.565
I just wanted to make sure you're comfortable getting setup.

00:00:17.565 --> 00:00:19.110
Before starting the video,

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.265
I made a project folder,

00:00:20.265 --> 00:00:24.015
initialize npm, and set Web3 as a dependency like before.

00:00:24.015 --> 00:00:28.320
From here, I'll open my editor and create an index.js file.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.100
What I can do now is paste in the same commands we ran through before.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.820
Now what you need to do is run the file using node and you're all set.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.440
For my integrated terminal,

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.630
I'll type node index.js,

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.935
and what I get back is a list of all the accounts like before.

00:00:42.935 --> 00:00:45.860
As a bonus command, I also included a line to show you

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.920
that you can pick just specific accounts from the list if you'd like.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.940
The accounts are returned as an array,

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.700
so you can choose one of these accounts by selecting an account from within the array.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.410
Try running this on different accounts to see how it works.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.060
So, that's it. Hopefully this quick video helps you get setup from your code editor.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.739
In the next videos, you'll see me working in VS Code,

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.200
but you can set up in whatever environment you'd like now.
