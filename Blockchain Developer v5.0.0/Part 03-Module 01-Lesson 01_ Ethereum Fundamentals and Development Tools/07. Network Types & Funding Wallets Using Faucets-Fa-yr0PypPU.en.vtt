00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.250
In this lesson, we'll go over the various Ethereum network types,

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.684
and how to connect to them using the MetaMask browser wallet.

00:00:07.684 --> 00:00:11.414
We'll introduce you to some of the faucets where you can

00:00:11.414 --> 00:00:14.769
request for some play Ether for your wallet counts.

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:16.879
Now, let's install MetaMask.

00:00:16.879 --> 00:00:19.564
So, I'm at metamask.io,

00:00:19.565 --> 00:00:22.700
and I've attached this link in the resources section.

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:24.679
So, you have two options;

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:27.230
you can download this as a Chrome plugin,

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.094
or a Brave browser plugin.

00:00:29.094 --> 00:00:31.019
So, I use Chrome and I use Brave as well.

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.524
So, for this demo, we'll just use Chrome.

00:00:33.524 --> 00:00:35.119
Yes. So, just click on this,

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:37.504
go through the installation process,

00:00:37.505 --> 00:00:41.700
and you'll have the MetaMask installed as a Chrome plugin.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.020
Now, once you have it installed,

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.845
you can login into MetaMask.

00:00:46.844 --> 00:00:51.524
And this is one of the ways you can login.

00:00:51.524 --> 00:00:56.989
In here, if you click on the different networks that are available,

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.210
you have the main network,

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.689
and you have the various tests networks as well.

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:10.739
Let's go back. Main Ethereum,

00:01:10.739 --> 00:01:12.909
it uses Proof of Work,

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.594
Ropsten uses Proof of Work as well,

00:01:15.594 --> 00:01:18.935
Kovan uses Proof of Authority,

00:01:18.935 --> 00:01:21.439
and Rinkeby uses Proof of Authority as well.

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:24.530
So, for this illustration, we'll use Rinkeby,

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.969
and then I'll just quickly show you how to request for some play money.

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:32.289
So, if you're using MetaMask,

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.234
you can go to faucet.metamask.io,

00:01:35.234 --> 00:01:38.375
and you can request for 'play ether' here.

00:01:38.375 --> 00:01:41.290
So, once you've connected to one of the addresses,

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.695
let's say Rinkeby, you can just request here,

00:01:44.694 --> 00:01:46.669
and then it'll show up in your MetaMask.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.359
So, you'll have a transaction.

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:51.069
So, I've requested before,

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:53.759
so when you click on that link,

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.465
it will show you in ropsten.etherscan when the transaction is successful.

00:01:59.465 --> 00:02:02.549
There's other ways to request as well.

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.594
So, if you went to,

00:02:04.594 --> 00:02:11.849
let's say faucet.rinkeby.io, you can also request,

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.574
it has three ways, you can essentially follow these instructions;

00:02:15.574 --> 00:02:19.379
Post a tweet or a Google plus or Facebook,

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.814
and get the link and post it here,

00:02:21.814 --> 00:02:27.159
and you can get the play money given to you through the faucet.

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:30.354
So, I've actually posted on Google Plus.

00:02:30.354 --> 00:02:33.074
So, this is basically my Ethereum address,

00:02:33.074 --> 00:02:35.569
I copy that link and I put it here,

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.245
and then you can say, 'give me Ether'.

00:02:37.245 --> 00:02:38.759
So, depending on what you want,

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:41.120
you can get three Ethers every eight hours,

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.025
7.5 every day and then 18.75 every three days.

00:02:46.025 --> 00:02:48.530
So, I'm just going to go with this one,

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.199
and it says, 'Click on all those store fronts'.

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:54.604
So, I think that looks like a store front,

00:02:54.604 --> 00:02:57.099
that one also looks like a storefront.

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:59.579
Let's see if it's going to work.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.629
It's thinking thinking thinking.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.600
So, while that's going through,

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:18.329
let's just go through a quick transaction.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.750
So, I've got some play, Ether here.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.259
So, in the previous class, we went through the graphical user interface.

00:03:26.258 --> 00:03:28.064
Remember, we have four accounts, so,

00:03:28.064 --> 00:03:32.310
let's say we want to send some play Ether from a MetaMask account

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.074
to my graphical user interface.

00:03:37.074 --> 00:03:39.609
So, I'll go here. Let me just get the address first.

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.970
So, go to the first one,

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:44.145
I'll copy my address,

00:03:44.145 --> 00:03:47.745
then I'll go to MetaMask and I'll say, 'send',

00:03:47.745 --> 00:03:56.485
and over here, so let's say I'm sending one Ether, and say 'confirm'.

00:03:56.485 --> 00:03:58.450
You're signing your transaction,

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:01.479
and then within a few seconds,

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:04.619
you should get, there you go.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.594
So, it went up to 6.5,

00:04:06.594 --> 00:04:09.185
it was 5.5 before we started the transaction.

00:04:09.185 --> 00:04:12.009
Yes. So, in conclusion,

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:14.849
we went over the various Ethereum network types,

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:17.469
and how to connect them using MetaMask,

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.380
you browse a wallet plug-in.

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:24.129
Now you know how to request for some play Ether for your faucets.

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:26.155
This wraps up this section,

00:04:26.154 --> 00:04:28.079
we'll see you in the next video.
