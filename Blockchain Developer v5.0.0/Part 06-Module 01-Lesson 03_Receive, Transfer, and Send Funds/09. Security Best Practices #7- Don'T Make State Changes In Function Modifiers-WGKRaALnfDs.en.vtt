00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
Our next security best practice is about function modifiers.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.285
Make sure you do not change state in function modifiers.

00:00:09.285 --> 00:00:12.689
Ideally, you should use them only for assertions.

00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:17.489
In general, when function modifiers are used if they change state.

00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:21.179
The function code might not be aware of this,

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:23.384
especially if you're using a shared library,

00:00:23.385 --> 00:00:29.445
and it might cause side effects that the function code is not prepared for.

00:00:29.445 --> 00:00:33.600
So in order to keep your code fluid and simple,

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.060
make sure that you do not have anything other

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.609
than assertions in function modifiers in general
