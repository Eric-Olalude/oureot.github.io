00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
Congratulations, you have successfully finished

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.690
the lesson on creating decentralized applications on Ethereum.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.620
We created two versions of the star notary contract.

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:12.394
The first one was a simple one,

00:00:12.394 --> 00:00:16.545
but it still helped you practice and use all the tools learned so far.

00:00:16.545 --> 00:00:18.795
We us truffle, truffle boxes,

00:00:18.795 --> 00:00:20.370
to get the boilerplate code.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.585
We also learned how to write unit tests to test smart contracts.

00:00:24.585 --> 00:00:28.214
We created a simple front end to interact with the contract.

00:00:28.214 --> 00:00:32.475
We also then created a tokenized version of the star notary contract.

00:00:32.475 --> 00:00:37.635
We used open Zeppelin to import the ERC 7-21 interface.

00:00:37.634 --> 00:00:41.839
We learned why we are choosing the ERC 7-21 interface,

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.420
which is used for non-fungible tokens.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.950
We wrote unit tests and created a simple front end for adapt.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.880
Congratulations again on coming so far.
