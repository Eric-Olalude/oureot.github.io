00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.339
Okay, let's get started.

00:00:02.339 --> 00:00:04.269
So, remember, we used a Truffle box to create

00:00:04.269 --> 00:00:06.774
a project that gives us a lot of boilerplate code.

00:00:06.775 --> 00:00:10.234
Now, like I said, it came with a lot of boilerplate code, we don't need some of it.

00:00:10.234 --> 00:00:12.009
In fact, quite a bit of it for a project.

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:13.119
I like to have a clean plate.

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:16.269
So, let's go clean up all the files that we don't need for this boilerplate.

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:18.634
The first thing I'm going to go to my contracts folder.

00:00:18.635 --> 00:00:19.950
Okay. In the contracts folder,

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.989
we're going to delete all the files except the migration file.

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:26.329
So, let's go delete this file. We don't need it.

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:29.304
Again, that's just boilerplate code that came along, I'm going to delete that.

00:00:29.304 --> 00:00:30.579
I'm also going to delete the other file,

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.894
I'm only going to have the migrations.sol left.

00:00:33.895 --> 00:00:36.460
Okay. Once you have that setup.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.280
Now, the next thing we're going to do is create our own contract file here.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.439
Okay. Then, we're going to copy the code that we hadn't Remix right here.

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:47.299
So, I'm going to call my file here, starNotary.sol.

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:49.864
So, let's go create our own contract here.

00:00:49.865 --> 00:00:55.495
I'm going to call it starNotary.sol, fantastic.

00:00:55.494 --> 00:00:58.609
I'm going to paste the code that we had initially from a Remix.

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:00.200
Okay. Then, hit save.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.700
So, you're saving the file here,

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.519
that's some clean up we did in the contract file folders.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.349
Now, we only have the migrations one left,

00:01:06.349 --> 00:01:09.894
under starNotary.sol, that we just have our own created.

00:01:09.894 --> 00:01:12.244
Now, let's go to the migrations file.

00:01:12.245 --> 00:01:14.930
In the migrations file, you'll see it's trying to migrate.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.940
Of course, you're going to leave the first one just the way it is.

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:19.549
The second one, is also migrating your other contracts.

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.219
We don't need that, I'm going to edit that to my own contract.

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:26.144
So, let's go delete one of them and edit the other one.

00:01:26.144 --> 00:01:30.869
Okay. So, the name of our file is starNotary.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.900
Let's also call this,

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.745
I'm going to use capital in this case, got it.

00:01:35.745 --> 00:01:37.800
We don't need to deploy any of this,

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.289
we just need to deploy our own one, right?

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.460
So, let's go delete that,

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:43.154
edit this to our starNotary.

00:01:43.155 --> 00:01:45.450
So, this is the file that actually migrate into

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.909
whatever network that you're putting it on, fantastic.

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.599
So, all of this is doing is that we edited this file,

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:56.000
and then if you see we're using artifacts to require the JSON format.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.180
If you probably saw all this in one of our lessons solidity.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.380
But again, what we're doing,

00:02:00.379 --> 00:02:03.964
is that we're using the artifacts that require the JSON format of our smart contract,

00:02:03.965 --> 00:02:06.305
then we're deploying it using this function right there.

00:02:06.305 --> 00:02:08.719
Now, let's also clean up a little bit more.

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:09.955
So, let's save this file,

00:02:09.955 --> 00:02:11.270
okay? So, we did two things.

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.210
We deleted everything in the contract for it except the migrations file,

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.145
and then had our own contract made there.

00:02:16.145 --> 00:02:18.920
Second thing, we came to a migrations folder.

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:23.034
Then, we edit the two underscore deploy contracts and just make our,

00:02:23.034 --> 00:02:25.669
yeah, starNotary contract is the one that we're deploying.

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:28.089
So, we made that change, and then also did it our test,

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.795
CPC look in the test folder.

00:02:29.794 --> 00:02:31.789
This is where we actually plays all the test files,

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:33.245
we'll look at that in just a second.

00:02:33.245 --> 00:02:35.180
In the test folder, I'm actually going to delete.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.800
Again, we don't need this one.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.360
This is again for the previous one,

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.370
we're going to delete this file,

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.629
and then we're also going to delete the TestMetacoin.sol.

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:46.189
So, pretty much delete everything,

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:49.400
and I'm going to have just my environments set up over here.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.460
So, let's delete this file too, fantastic.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.585
Just leave this one there, this is just the basic environments set up for you.

00:02:56.585 --> 00:03:01.670
Now, within that, we're going to create our own test file and all the tests files are.js,

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:03.979
and I'll give you more details of that in the next video.

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:05.840
So, let's go create our own file,

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.420
we're going to call it starNotary,

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:09.509
that is how you write your tests.

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:12.465
Fantastic. So, starNotary.js, so this is our test file.

00:03:12.465 --> 00:03:15.080
Now, again we have learned about [inaudible].

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.200
Now, let's go start writing tests for my next video.
