00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.235
Let me walk you through all the tools that you will be using to finish this lesson.

00:00:04.235 --> 00:00:07.110
We've already covered all of these tools in the previous lessons,

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.165
so you should have everything already setup.

00:00:09.164 --> 00:00:11.609
Let's quickly go over all of them again to

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:14.234
make sure that you have everything installed that would be needed.

00:00:14.234 --> 00:00:16.619
The first thing we're going to be using is remix.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.179
That's the online editor to write

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:21.550
a smart contracts and that's the website remix.etheriurm.org.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.285
We have of course use this many times in our previous lessons.

00:00:24.285 --> 00:00:26.655
The next thing we're going to using is truffle.

00:00:26.655 --> 00:00:27.975
That's the truffle website.

00:00:27.975 --> 00:00:30.945
If you see Truffle is a completed app development framework.

00:00:30.945 --> 00:00:32.850
So, we're going to write a contract in remix,

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.815
and then we will bring it to truffle.

00:00:34.814 --> 00:00:37.379
Truffle really helps us in writing unit tests,

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.984
and also compiling contracts,

00:00:38.984 --> 00:00:41.615
and you can also run a local Ethereum test network

00:00:41.615 --> 00:00:44.454
or you can also connect to any of the public networks.

00:00:44.454 --> 00:00:46.699
It is available as an npm package.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.155
Let's go to your terminal window to make sure that we have truffle installed.

00:00:50.155 --> 00:00:52.609
So, in your terminal window again you should have

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:54.560
it installed because we've done truffle before this,

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.100
but if you want to make sure that you haven't installed just type truffle-v,

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.620
and that should tell you if you have truffle installed.

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:03.890
So, we have truffle installed, if you don't have it installed all you have to do is

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.504
npm install-g for global truffle.

00:01:08.504 --> 00:01:10.670
I'm not going to hit Enter because I already have that installed,

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.890
but that's the command that going to be using if you

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.670
really want to install truffle if you don't have that installed.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.609
Also wanted to let you know that truffle comes as a command line interface.

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:23.120
Now, the next tool we're going to be using is called truffle boxes.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.605
Now, truffle boxes if you look at their website is truffleframework/boxes,

00:01:27.605 --> 00:01:30.200
and truffle boxes are pre-built projects for

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.905
truffle framework that developers can download and use as a starting point.

00:01:33.905 --> 00:01:36.400
They come with a lot of boilerplate code to write,

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.285
test, and deploy smart contracts.

00:01:38.284 --> 00:01:41.299
These are truffle boxes and of course there are a lot of truffle boxes,

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:42.739
but there are sample react.

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:44.959
They have everything already built up for the front page,

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:48.819
and then they also have truffle boxes to create complete tokens and much more.

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:50.609
They also have silver configured,

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:53.329
you can always go through all these different truffle boxes.

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.209
So again we're going to use the truffle box which is called web pack.

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:59.224
This is what we are going to be using as a starting point to create our depth.

00:01:59.224 --> 00:02:01.009
Now, how do we get started with truffle box?

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.930
We're going to go back to our terminal.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.760
Let's go delete this command.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.079
The first thing that we're going to do is make

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:08.254
a directory for our project. So I'm going to do it.

00:02:08.254 --> 00:02:10.699
So, remember we're making two different versions of a contract,

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:13.280
I'm going to call the first one starNotary version one.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.890
So let's make a directory.

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:17.609
So I'm going to make a directly starNotaryv1,

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.065
and that's what I'm calling that.

00:02:19.064 --> 00:02:22.275
Got it. Then now let's go inside that directory.

00:02:22.275 --> 00:02:24.545
Of course there's everything's empty now.

00:02:24.544 --> 00:02:27.019
The first thing that you want to do is you want to do unbox.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.755
So you are going to say truffle unbox,

00:02:29.754 --> 00:02:32.769
and then we're going to use a web pack is the name of the truffle box we're using.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:33.960
Once you do run that,

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.030
it's going to install a bunch of things and we're going to let it run.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.289
So, again now just to let you know truffle box Web Pack comes with a lot of

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:40.879
boilerplate code for the front-end for

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.299
your data and the front end is written in HTML and JavaScript.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.850
It really makes everything simple because they've already

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:49.159
set up the directories and the structures and all that stuff.

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:51.335
So, let's go run this command now.

00:02:51.335 --> 00:02:54.560
It takes about maybe less than a minute for everything to unpack,

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.375
and this is what truffle box is.

00:02:56.375 --> 00:02:59.270
So, like I said it comes with the server so you can host a front-end on

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.210
your computer and so

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.040
it installs all the [inaudible] While it's getting ready for

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:08.150
that also want to let you know you can also compile,

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.800
it comes with its own development console,

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.495
so you can sort of truffle develop,

00:03:11.495 --> 00:03:13.189
once you do that It actually runs

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:16.805
a local Ethereum network on your computer that you can always use.

00:03:16.805 --> 00:03:19.159
It takes about a little second, we're going to let this finish.

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:21.229
and then I'm going to come back in the next video,

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:24.329
and then show you what other tools that we're going to be using.
