00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.745
Hey, I'm Brandy!

00:00:01.745 --> 00:00:04.304
For over 15 years I've focused

00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:07.854
my professional career in every corner of the tech industry.

00:00:07.855 --> 00:00:11.905
Now, I'm leading blockchain initiatives here at Udacity.

00:00:11.904 --> 00:00:16.899
I'm looking forward to providing you with a fantastic program experience.

00:00:16.899 --> 00:00:19.369
We're not busy leading the blockchain initiatives,

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.470
you can find me hacking software sandboxes,

00:00:22.469 --> 00:00:27.219
tinkering with my 3D printer or spending quality time with my beloved family.

00:00:27.219 --> 00:00:29.429
At Udacity where a team,

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.545
an organization that cares about you and your learning experience.

00:00:33.545 --> 00:00:36.510
Looking forward to our journey together.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.560
Hey, I'm Jessica! Here at Udacity,

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.620
I've worked on the open ecosystem for Android and I've

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:47.059
taught in the Android developer and Android basics Nanodegree.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.800
Prior to that I helped develop and deploy enterprise healthcare software.

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:55.134
That enabled hospitals to reduce medical errors and improve patient health care.

00:00:55.134 --> 00:00:57.519
What excites me about blockchain applications,

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.820
is that is the next stage in the evolution of

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.585
how we connect and interact with the world through data.

00:01:02.585 --> 00:01:05.070
I love that it's openness will help reduce errors and

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:08.529
improve efficiencies across many industries.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.799
Hey, I'm Joe! I started my journey into tech as

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.685
a Udacity student and I've been helping build content here for the past few years.

00:01:16.685 --> 00:01:19.189
As a past student I know the challenges you'll face,

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:20.870
and want to assure you that we're all here to

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.115
help you achieve the goals you set for yourself.

00:01:23.114 --> 00:01:25.819
If there's ever anything any of us can do to help,

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:27.259
please be sure to reach out to us.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.935
So welcome again to Udacity's Blockchain Developer Nanodegree program,

00:01:30.935 --> 00:01:32.715
we're super excited to have you join us,

00:01:32.715 --> 00:01:34.609
so let's get started.

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:36.939
Hello, I'm PK!

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:38.724
I studied computers,

00:01:38.724 --> 00:01:40.789
both at the hardware and software level.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.594
I have lived and worked in several countries

00:01:43.593 --> 00:01:47.359
helping private and public companies transform their businesses.

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:49.688
Soon after I discovered blockchain,

00:01:49.688 --> 00:01:54.279
like many couldn't ignore it and for some reason I kept coming back to it.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.510
I love learning and teaching all things blockchain.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.125
At the Udacity I am part of an amazing team,

00:02:01.125 --> 00:02:04.000
and our objective is to provide you with the resources you

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.310
need to architect and build a blockchain career.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.830
My mates and I are so looking forward to sharing with you everything we know.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.880
See you at the next block.
