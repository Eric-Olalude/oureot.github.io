Alright. So that's the end of this introduction to blockchain.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.370
It was quick, but hopefully,

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.140
it gives you some perspective on what we'll be

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:09.439
covering and what you'll learn in this program.

00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:11.910
We'll start off the next lesson by going over some of

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.929
the blockchain basics and you'll already be on your way to completing your first project.

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.739
We put some details about the next lesson below the video.

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:24.404
If you want, take a second to look over what's coming up or jump straight into it.

00:00:24.405 --> 00:00:26.690
See you there.
