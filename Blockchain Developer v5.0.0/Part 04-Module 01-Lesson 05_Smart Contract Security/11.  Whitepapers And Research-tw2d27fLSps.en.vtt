00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
Along with existing documentation you can find online,

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.880
there are set of white papers that continue to help us

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.015
understand known vulnerabilities within smart contracts.

00:00:09.015 --> 00:00:12.120
In this video, I'll go over three of them I've read so far

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.960
and point out pieces of them that I think would be particularly useful to you.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.670
Before I jump into them,

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.520
keep in mind that while white papers can be a bit dense,

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.130
I've found that they are extremely clear and concise ways to

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.115
get a really strong understanding of the topics they present.

00:00:26.115 --> 00:00:27.810
For each of these I provided

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.005
a general outline of the topics they cover down below the video.

00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:33.330
This will help you see a little more clearly where they

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.915
overlap and which ones have completely unique information to look at.

00:00:36.915 --> 00:00:39.480
A lot of the topics you in see these papers will

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.500
eventually exists somewhere else in a friendlier format.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.890
I'll show you examples of that to in blogs and documentation.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.705
The first paper I found is called 'A survey of attacks on Ethereum smart contracts'.

00:00:50.705 --> 00:00:54.875
This paper breaks down a list of all the known vulnerabilities they could find.

00:00:54.875 --> 00:00:58.610
The first couple of pages are general background to smart contracts.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.710
But if you scroll down the page six,

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.600
they layout a taxonomy that includes

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.675
these attacks categorized by the type of vulnerability.

00:01:05.675 --> 00:01:08.750
To me, it's interesting to see that they've been broken down into

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.525
multiple levels of architecture including solidity,

00:01:11.525 --> 00:01:13.570
the EVM and the blockchain.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.210
This lesson is mostly focused on solidity vulnerabilities but

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.065
it's important to understand that there are other types of vulnerabilities too.

00:01:21.065 --> 00:01:23.510
Scrolling down, you'll see that some of this you're

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.390
familiar with already and some might be brand new to you.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.045
Checking out the variety of code examples they provide

00:01:29.045 --> 00:01:32.240
is helpful even if you have a good grasp of the concepts.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.260
One thing you might notice here is that the parody attack isn't even mentioned.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.525
That's because this was written in 2016 before this attack ever happened.

00:01:40.525 --> 00:01:42.165
Before diving into this paper,

00:01:42.165 --> 00:01:44.290
there's two more I want to walk you through.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.880
The next paper is along one but I'll just

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.535
point out the parts that are important for us to use right now.

00:01:49.535 --> 00:01:51.440
This one is called 'Ethereum Smart

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.790
Contracts: Security Vulnerabilities and Security Tools'.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.445
On page seven, is the table of contents.

00:01:57.445 --> 00:01:59.740
Under related work, you'll see their list of

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.335
vulnerabilities that they found for this document.

00:02:02.335 --> 00:02:05.170
Right away, we can already see something we're familiar with.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.630
This paper also broke the vulnerabilities into

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.170
three main categories and from there mentioned similar ideas.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.480
You can read through this section to see if it helps

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.480
clarify anything that may have not been mentioned previously.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.880
Along with these vulnerabilities this paper

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.360
also does an excellent job covering the introduction,

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.545
background, related work, methodology and many experiments related to smart contracts.

00:02:26.545 --> 00:02:29.230
This one would definitely take a while to get through and you might

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.020
not read all of it but it's worth knowing that it exists.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.995
Finally, the last paper I want to show you is called 'Making smart Contracts Smarter'.

00:02:36.995 --> 00:02:40.070
This one helped me the most personally and understanding a lot of

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.360
the possible attacks while the other papers sort of fill in the gaps from there.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.580
I like how they break this one down into known issues,

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.880
possible attacks, the code and a conceptual overview.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.040
This breakdown inspired how I introduced

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.080
the DAO and parody attack and allows you to

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.495
think about the problem from multiple perspectives.

00:02:56.495 --> 00:02:58.430
Once you get down into section four,

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.490
it's pretty dense and isn't really anything you need to know for now.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.440
If it's interesting to you definitely takes

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.885
some time to read through and see what you get out of it.

00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:08.870
The last thing, like I mentioned is that many of these ideas

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.810
are covered in a more reader friendly way and other places.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.765
For one, the consensus documentation I showed you has an entire section on known attacks.

00:03:16.765 --> 00:03:20.240
Besides that you can Google the name of any attack that's difficult

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.065
to grasp and there might be a post about it that's done to fill in the gaps for you.

00:03:24.065 --> 00:03:27.395
That wraps up this overview of research and white papers.

00:03:27.395 --> 00:03:31.170
I know this seems like a lot right now but what I'm hoping is that by looking at this,

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.930
you will soon be pleasantly surprised to

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.215
see that there's a ton of similarities between them.

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:38.450
Also, if you look up videos on YouTube about security,

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.685
there pretty much either referencing papers like this

00:03:40.685 --> 00:03:43.130
or using them as motivation for their own examples.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.975
So, if you're clear on these papers

00:03:44.975 --> 00:03:47.345
you'll really be in a good place as you continue learning.

00:03:47.345 --> 00:03:49.760
Check out the outlines I placed below the videos for

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.310
each of the papers to see what you'd like to focus on first.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.250
So, have fun exploring and once you get the hang of this you will

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.870
have developed a great sense for known attacks on the Ethereum network.
