00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.245
Congratulations. You made it to the end of this lesson on Smart Contracts Security.

00:00:05.245 --> 00:00:07.470
This is such an important topic and

00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:10.559
your expertise in this field will be extremely valuable.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.450
With smart contracts security,

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:14.339
your journey doesn't end here.

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.009
I spent most of this lesson pointing you towards

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.660
helpful resources that you can spend time researching in the future.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.410
Beyond this research, it helps to find your own resources or

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.100
reference documentation that aggregates these resources for you.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.740
You now understand the details behind some of

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:33.934
the largest hacks that have ever happened on the Ethereum network,

00:00:33.935 --> 00:00:36.109
the DAO and Parity hacks.

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:37.804
Hopefully along the way,

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:40.054
you picked up some good examples you can take with you

00:00:40.054 --> 00:00:42.909
to be a more effective smart contract developer.

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:47.029
At this point, it's your turn to join the rapidly developing ecosystem of

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.130
tools and communities that are coming together

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.725
to help ensure the security of smart contracts.

00:00:51.725 --> 00:00:53.710
As I said in the beginning of this lesson,

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.810
this is an extremely valuable skill to have as a developer,

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.210
and you'll continue utilizing all these skills for

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.669
as long as you continue developing smart contracts
