00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.349
Hey, and welcome to this lesson on decentralized file storage.

00:00:04.349 --> 00:00:08.669
Throughout this lesson, we'll go over the fundamentals of decentralized file storage,

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:10.650
also known as DFS.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.470
We'll cover many new concepts to help get you up and

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.350
running with decentralized file storage for yourself.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.300
To start, you'll get a broad overview of what DFS is and how it's being used to

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.399
try and replace some extremely important internet protocols, specifically HTTP.

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:29.729
You'll learn how it compliments decentralized apps created in

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.564
Ethereum to create fully decentralized unstoppable applications.

00:00:34.564 --> 00:00:40.724
From there, we'll focus specifically on one implementation of DFS known as IPFS,

00:00:40.725 --> 00:00:43.079
the Interplanetary File System.

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.324
That's a big name, and their goals are even bigger.

00:00:46.325 --> 00:00:52.105
Their goal is to replace HTTP as the protocol we use to share information online.

00:00:52.104 --> 00:00:56.964
Using IPFS, you'll learn to share files like text, images,

00:00:56.965 --> 00:01:01.130
videos and more onto a shared network that just like a blockchain,

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.570
cannot be censored or changed and is not owned by any centralized source.

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:07.750
By the end of this lesson,

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.950
you'll have published your own personal website on

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.920
IPFS you can use to showcase your new projects,

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.260
skills or anything else you'd like.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.340
You'll also be challenged to publish your own decentralized application onto

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.450
IPFS to create your first fully decentralized application.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.829
We've got a lot to cover,

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:26.120
and I'm excited to get started.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.350
So, when you're ready,

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:29.549
I'll see you in the first section.
