00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.375
Congratulations on completing this lesson.

00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:07.995
Throughout this lesson we went over the fundamentals of decentralized file storage.

00:00:07.995 --> 00:00:13.245
You also learnt many new ideas to help get you up and running with IPFS.

00:00:13.244 --> 00:00:17.250
You learnt the details of what DFS is and how it's being used to

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.300
try and replace current Internet protocols like HTTP.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.380
We also went over how DFS can work with Ethereum

00:00:24.379 --> 00:00:27.614
file to create fully decentralized applications.

00:00:27.614 --> 00:00:31.619
You now also know how to work with IPFS to share texts,

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.925
images, videos, websites and apps.

00:00:34.924 --> 00:00:37.309
If you followed along with each section,

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.410
you've published your own personal website on

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:42.819
IPFS that you can use to showcase your new projects,

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.094
skills or anything else you'd like.

00:00:45.094 --> 00:00:48.500
You've also published your own decentralized application onto

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.384
IPFS to create your first fully decentralized application.

00:00:52.384 --> 00:00:54.589
So, congratulations again.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.180
I'm excited that you've made it this far.

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:58.729
I hope you're able to continue experimenting with

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:02.739
IPFS to create many more decentralized apps.
