00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.865
Throughout this lesson, we'll mostly be covering

00:00:02.865 --> 00:00:05.625
new concepts through coding and exercises.

00:00:05.625 --> 00:00:07.139
But before we dive in,

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:09.750
there's a few important concepts to understand without

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.794
code that will go over in this and the next section.

00:00:12.794 --> 00:00:14.564
To start in this video,

00:00:14.564 --> 00:00:16.679
I'll answer some of the bigger questions surrounding

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:21.210
decentralized storage including how it compares to existing solutions.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.980
To answer this question,

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.670
we have to zoom way out and think about what the internet even is.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.270
In short, it's a collection of protocols or rules meant

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.899
to decide the best way to move and share information across a network.

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.890
Many of these protocols were originally suggestions by

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.564
developers that were adopted as best practices over time.

00:00:40.564 --> 00:00:43.429
This is similar to how the block chain space is now,

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:46.700
with everyone contributing towards creating a better future.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.200
One of the protocols that has come to dominate the web is HTTP.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.109
We all use HTTP everyday but to be precise,

00:00:55.109 --> 00:01:00.649
HTTP is a protocol that defines how messages are formatted and transmitted by the web.

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.049
It also helps determine the actions that

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:06.170
web servers and browsers take when given certain commands.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.254
This has worked extremely well in the past but like many things in the blockchain space,

00:01:11.254 --> 00:01:13.354
we think it can be improved.

00:01:13.355 --> 00:01:16.145
This is where distributed storage comes in.

00:01:16.144 --> 00:01:19.795
It's goal is to be a replacement for the HTTP protocol.

00:01:19.795 --> 00:01:24.439
It's trying to reimagine how we format and transmit information over the web.

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:27.079
It's embracing all the same blockchain principles

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:29.718
like decentralization and peer-to-peer networks,

00:01:29.718 --> 00:01:31.894
and applying them to file storage.

00:01:31.894 --> 00:01:34.069
Similar to how Bitcoin didn't want

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:37.474
financial transactions to be controlled by centralized banks,

00:01:37.474 --> 00:01:42.019
IPFS doesn't want our data to be controlled by centralized tech companies.

00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:46.074
For example, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google,

00:01:46.075 --> 00:01:50.615
and others are amazing companies that provide us with a ton of unique services.

00:01:50.614 --> 00:01:55.824
The problem is, everything we do on their platforms generates data that they own.

00:01:55.825 --> 00:02:00.004
It's up to them to manage how this information is stored and distributed,

00:02:00.004 --> 00:02:03.259
and they can control what we see and what we don't see.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.190
Even if these companies get it right,

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.819
there's still the chance that governments will decide what

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:11.509
information is and isn't allowed to be seen by their citizens.

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:14.959
As an example, citizens from the country of Turkey woke up

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.814
one day to find that their access to the internet had been taken away from them.

00:02:18.814 --> 00:02:23.109
What are you supposed to do when the government blocks your access to information?

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.685
Similarly, many of us use Google every day but it's been blocked by countries like China,

00:02:28.685 --> 00:02:30.259
several Middle Eastern countries,

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:32.599
and a few other places around the world.

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:38.139
This inability to share information keeps us from making progress as a global community.

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:42.064
Currently, there are a few technologies trying to tackle this problem.

00:02:42.064 --> 00:02:44.240
Most notable are IPFS,

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.760
the InterPlanetary File System and Swarm,

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:48.439
a project built by Ethereum,

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:51.379
as well as others like Storage, and SIA.

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:54.590
All these protocols are attempting to solve the problems of

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.840
decentralized file storage to help redefine

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.719
the way we manage and distribute files online.

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:02.449
These ideas work as a perfect complement

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:05.244
to the decentralized applications we've been creating.

00:03:05.245 --> 00:03:08.784
Ethereum, while helping us build these decentralized applications,

00:03:08.784 --> 00:03:13.805
only really decentralizes the computation by using the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

00:03:13.805 --> 00:03:15.724
One problem with Ethereum,

00:03:15.724 --> 00:03:18.625
is that it's an extremely expensive way to store files.

00:03:18.625 --> 00:03:22.294
So, to deal with this, we still have to use things like cloud storage providers,

00:03:22.294 --> 00:03:25.084
including Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services,

00:03:25.085 --> 00:03:27.409
and others to host our applications.

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:32.030
But if you take decentralized computation and centralize the storage,

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.985
is that really a decentralized application at all?

00:03:34.985 --> 00:03:37.430
The answer is up for debate by the community,

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.474
but that's exactly where decentralized storage comes in.

00:03:40.474 --> 00:03:42.530
They work as the storage providers,

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.280
and allow you to decentralize an entirely new layer of your application.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.819
Hopefully now, you understand the goals of decentralized storage,

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:52.759
how it aims to compete with the HTTP protocol,

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:54.590
and the benefits of choosing this over

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.490
traditional centralized technologies for hosting your application.
