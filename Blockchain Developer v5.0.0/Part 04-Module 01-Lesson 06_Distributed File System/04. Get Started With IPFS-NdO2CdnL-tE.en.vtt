00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.299
In this video, I'll show you how to install IPFS,

00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:04.949
go over some basic commands,

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.349
how to connect with other peers on the network,

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:09.060
and how to use the web UI.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.560
By the end of the video,

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.824
you should be able to explore a lot of the basic features and commands for yourself.

00:00:14.824 --> 00:00:16.439
All right. So first,

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.425
open your terminal and type which IPFS.

00:00:19.425 --> 00:00:21.690
This will tell you where IPFS is

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.214
installed and let you know whether or not you have it installed already.

00:00:25.214 --> 00:00:29.295
It's likely you don't but this command may be helpful in the future.

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:33.870
If you don't, then you can type the following command into your terminal to get it.

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:38.774
It'll be at Gogetgithub.com slash the rest of the command here.

00:00:38.774 --> 00:00:40.344
I've put it down below the video,

00:00:40.344 --> 00:00:42.664
so you can just paste it into your terminal.

00:00:42.664 --> 00:00:44.473
I already have IPFS,

00:00:44.473 --> 00:00:46.109
so I won't be running this.

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:49.200
This will start to install IPFS for you.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.710
If it's taking a little bit,

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.509
feel free to pause the video before moving on.

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:55.784
Once the installation is complete,

00:00:55.784 --> 00:00:58.094
you'll need to initialize IPFS.

00:00:58.094 --> 00:01:01.320
This sets up an IPFS repository for you.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.200
To do this, I'll type, IPFS in it.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.579
When I run the command,

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:08.000
I get this error here.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.504
You'll see this too if you ever run IPFS in it again,

00:01:11.504 --> 00:01:13.324
you only need to run it once.

00:01:13.325 --> 00:01:15.380
But if this is your first time,

00:01:15.379 --> 00:01:20.869
you'll see some type of welcome message that includes IPFS and your personal hash value.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.719
After it's initialized, you can paste in the line shown at the bottom of your terminal.

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:31.564
It'll say IPFS cat followed by a hash value and ending in Read Me.

00:01:31.564 --> 00:01:34.310
That takes you to this welcome screen.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.909
Feel free to explore all the commands they show you here like about,

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.569
help, Quickstart, and security notes.

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:43.414
To me, it's helpful to go straight to the Quickstart.

00:01:43.415 --> 00:01:49.140
To do this, run the same command as before but replace Read Me with Quickstart.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.734
This shows you a lot of helpful information for getting started.

00:01:56.734 --> 00:02:00.334
I'll go over a few examples later of how to work with IPFS.

00:02:00.334 --> 00:02:03.204
But not specifically what is shown in this Quickstart.

00:02:03.204 --> 00:02:05.144
It's all laid out pretty well here.

00:02:05.144 --> 00:02:07.069
So, if you'd like, feel free to run through with

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:10.159
the HelloWorld example to get more familiar with everything.

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:16.465
Next, you can look at a lot of the basic commands available by running the command IPFS.

00:02:16.465 --> 00:02:20.960
Scrolling through quickly, you can see that they're grouped into basic commands,

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.045
data structure, advanced commands,

00:02:23.044 --> 00:02:25.254
network commands, and tool commands.

00:02:25.254 --> 00:02:28.069
Throughout the lesson, we won't have time to use all of

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.984
these commands but you can refer back to this to try some of them for yourself.

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:36.170
Actually, this isn't even all of the commands available in IPFS.

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:40.384
To get a list of all of them, run IPFS commands.

00:02:40.384 --> 00:02:43.009
There's no reason to memorize all of

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:45.965
these commands but it's important to know how to explore them.

00:02:45.965 --> 00:02:51.155
To do that, you can type in any command name followed by help to get more information.

00:02:51.155 --> 00:02:56.085
For example, try IPFS version, help.

00:02:56.085 --> 00:02:58.420
I just took version from here.

00:02:58.539 --> 00:03:03.019
That gives you all of the information about what this command does.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.110
This version command is pretty simple so try running it to

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.080
see what version of IPFS you have installed on your computer.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.629
Looks like I have version 0.4.103.

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.984
Also, you don't always have to use the terminal to learn more about these commands.

00:03:19.985 --> 00:03:28.440
You can also find them at IPFS.io/docs/commands. Let's check that out now.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.784
Here you see the same exact list of

00:03:36.784 --> 00:03:40.305
all the different commands that we were looking at before in the terminal.

00:03:40.305 --> 00:03:44.599
Or you can click on them to see more instead of having to run them in the help menu.

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.389
All right. Well, let's get back to the terminal for now.

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:49.864
Now that we're more familiar with IPFS,

00:03:49.865 --> 00:03:52.659
the next cool thing we can do is connect to the network.

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:54.030
To do this is simple,

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.819
by running the command IPFS daemon.

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:02.859
You should see a bunch of information come up giving you

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.830
details about the different addresses you're connected to.

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.630
Once this daemon is running,

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:10.900
you'll need to open a new tab and leave that one running in the background.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.819
I'll do that by hitting command T. That's all there really is to getting onto

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:18.399
the network but there's a few simple commands that are helpful to

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:21.599
get started with by typing IPFS ID,

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.265
you'll see your note information including the ID,

00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:26.860
public-key, addresses and more.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.770
Next, you can see what appears you are connected to on

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:34.129
the network by typing IPFS swarm peers.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.900
What you get back is a list of all the other nodes on

00:04:37.899 --> 00:04:40.914
the network that you just connected to by running the daemon.

00:04:40.915 --> 00:04:45.095
Do the same notes that would be uploading and sharing files on the network.

00:04:45.095 --> 00:04:48.455
Similar to how you ran IPFS ID for yourself,

00:04:48.454 --> 00:04:51.289
you can also run IPFS ID on one of

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.670
these peers by pasting the hash value in after the command.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:05:00.694
Try this for yourself by typing IPFS ID followed by one of the hash values from the list.

00:05:00.694 --> 00:05:02.939
I'll take this one here.

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:07.849
What you get back is the same information you had for

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.865
yourself but now for another node on the network.

00:05:10.865 --> 00:05:13.699
The last thing I wanted to show you is the web UI.

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:16.519
This UI shows a lot of the same information you can

00:05:16.519 --> 00:05:19.759
get from the terminal but it has some nice features you might like.

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:25.569
To get there, open your browser backup and type in localhost5001webui.

00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:31.370
What you'll see is that the URL updates to match your peer ID

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.795
and a page that includes information like note info and network addresses.

00:05:35.795 --> 00:05:37.509
Over on the left is a menu.

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:39.709
Which includes home which is where you are now,

00:05:39.709 --> 00:05:42.979
connections, files, DAG, and Config.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.870
By clicking on connections,

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.639
you can see all the same peers is when you ran IPFS warrant peers in the terminal.

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:54.110
You can see them all on this cool-looking globe and rotate it to see where everyone is.

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.569
Scrolling down, you'll notice that all the peers are

00:05:56.569 --> 00:05:59.545
over on the right with just a single globe on the left.

00:05:59.545 --> 00:06:03.860
To me, that seems like an odd design choice but I heard it was done on purpose.

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.725
The space below earth is because they're leaving room for

00:06:06.725 --> 00:06:11.689
all the other planets to fit in as this becomes an actual interplanetary filesystem.

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:13.860
I'm not totally sure if that's true,

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.555
but if so, that's an extremely forward thinking design choice.

00:06:17.555 --> 00:06:19.280
All right, besides this,

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:21.829
you can also see all the files you have on the network.

00:06:21.829 --> 00:06:23.509
I've been doing some stuff here already.

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:25.259
So I have a list of local files.

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:27.259
But yours is probably still empty.

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:31.324
You can upload any file here by clicking and dragging it to this box.

00:06:31.324 --> 00:06:34.459
Once it's uploaded, you'll see the ID here and

00:06:34.459 --> 00:06:37.534
you can open either the raw file or the DAG.

00:06:37.535 --> 00:06:41.105
It looks like I uploaded a file that says new text file.

00:06:41.105 --> 00:06:44.000
I'm proud to have made such a great contribution to the network.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.189
Next up is DAG and Config.

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:50.000
Feel free to check them out but we won't be working with them much throughout the lesson.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.819
Dag stands for Directed Acyclic Graph.

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:56.014
Which is related to how IPFS stores information.

00:06:56.014 --> 00:06:59.409
All right. So, that wraps up this intro to IPFS.

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:01.370
You've come a pretty long way already.

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.995
In this video, you installed IPFS,

00:07:03.995 --> 00:07:06.605
went through the basic commands, ran the daemon,

00:07:06.605 --> 00:07:09.770
explored peers, and got set up with the Web UI.

00:07:09.769 --> 00:07:11.584
We breeze through it pretty quickly.

00:07:11.584 --> 00:07:13.609
So I do recommend going back through things

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.220
like the Quickstart and a couple of help commands.

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.510
If you don't, you won't be lost or anything

00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:20.855
throughout the lesson but the more you explore,

00:07:20.855 --> 00:07:22.025
the more you'll be able to do.

00:07:22.024 --> 00:07:23.679
So, why not try it out.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.470
Coming up, we'll head back to the terminal to start working with files in IPFS.
