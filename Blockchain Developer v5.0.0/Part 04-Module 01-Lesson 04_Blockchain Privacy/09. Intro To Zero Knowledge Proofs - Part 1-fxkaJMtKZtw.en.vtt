00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
Now let's learn about a really cool and really powerful privacy technique

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.120
called zero-knowledge proofs.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.083
A proof is just like it sounds,

00:00:08.083 --> 00:00:09.809
but of course in cryptography,

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.530
we think of proof in terms of incontrovertible proof.

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:16.579
Kind of like how in the video on hashing,

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:20.929
we wanted incontrovertible proof that the pre-image matched,

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:23.199
or in the video on message signing,

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:25.589
we wanted incontrovertible proof that

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:28.815
a message was signed by the holder of a private key,

00:00:28.815 --> 00:00:31.230
that same standard applies here.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.350
The zero knowledge part means that the person you're proving

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.835
to doesn't learn anything more than the bare fact that you're proving.

00:00:38.835 --> 00:00:41.480
For example, say I want to prove to you

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:43.879
that I know the secret about how to play baseball,

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.230
and this secret lets me hit a home run every single time I go to bat.

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:51.184
Since that's not something most people can do,

00:00:51.185 --> 00:00:53.344
if we could demonstrate that somehow,

00:00:53.344 --> 00:00:57.379
then you'd probably be pretty sure that I do know a secret.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.800
But, how would we prove something like that?

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:04.504
Well, I could invite you to a baseball field with me,

00:01:04.504 --> 00:01:06.304
and you could throw mission pitches,

00:01:06.305 --> 00:01:08.825
and I could go knock them all at the park.

00:01:08.825 --> 00:01:10.909
After doing this enough times,

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.939
you'd be pretty convinced that I really do know the secret that I claim.

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.659
But, I didn't have to share with you that exact secret in order to prove that I had it.

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:22.920
That's a zero-knowledge proof.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.295
Now, a couple things to note about that.

00:01:25.295 --> 00:01:27.530
The first is, I could've been lucky,

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.989
maybe I don't really have a secret,

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:31.834
and you threw me a ball,

00:01:31.834 --> 00:01:32.929
and just by luck,

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.235
I hit a home run.

00:01:34.234 --> 00:01:38.299
You don't really have any real way of knowing the difference except by throwing me

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:43.039
enough pitches until you satisfy yourself that it's not just luck.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.700
This is what's called an interactive proof.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.555
Now, if we're doing this in data,

00:01:49.555 --> 00:01:54.125
we may have to pass some values back and forth several times until you're satisfied

00:01:54.125 --> 00:01:58.864
that it's the secret that's giving me the right answers, and not just luck.

00:01:58.864 --> 00:02:02.599
The second thing to note about interactive proofs is,

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:05.254
this proof is really only convincing to you.

00:02:05.254 --> 00:02:10.219
Anybody who was watching us can't really be sure that we're doing

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:16.115
a real proof or maybe we've conspired to have some kind of rehearsed performance.

00:02:16.115 --> 00:02:18.433
Because they're not part of the interaction,

00:02:18.433 --> 00:02:22.175
there's no way to convince them that there's not some,

00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:24.844
say trick when you pitched me the ball.

00:02:24.844 --> 00:02:29.150
The opposite of an interactive proof is a non-interactive proof.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.064
Non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs are proofs where

00:02:33.064 --> 00:02:37.055
the secret holder can create a proof without relying on anyone else.

00:02:37.055 --> 00:02:38.640
For an example of this,

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:42.924
let's say I have standard Fitch to card poker deck.

00:02:42.925 --> 00:02:44.969
I can show everyone that deck,

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:49.004
and prove that it has 26 Red cards and 26 black cards,

00:02:49.004 --> 00:02:50.430
then I shuffle a deck,

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.825
and I remove one card from the deck.

00:02:52.824 --> 00:02:55.144
Now, I see that it's a red card,

00:02:55.145 --> 00:02:57.719
and I want to prove to you that I'm holding a red card,

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:00.745
but I don't want to reveal exactly which card it is.

00:03:00.745 --> 00:03:03.384
Well, in this case, there's a trick.

00:03:03.384 --> 00:03:06.370
I can go through the remainder of the card deck,

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.925
and turnover every single black card on the deck.

00:03:09.925 --> 00:03:13.210
Once I revealed all 26 black cards,

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.085
but none of the red cards,

00:03:15.085 --> 00:03:19.570
anyone who sees my proof knows for sure I'm holding a red card.

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:21.324
No interaction required.

00:03:21.324 --> 00:03:26.159
So, what do zero-knowledge proofs with data look like?

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:28.634
Well, you've already seen some.

00:03:28.634 --> 00:03:32.959
For example, rings signatures we learned about earlier in the last video,

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.855
are zero-knowledge proofs of set membership.

00:03:35.854 --> 00:03:38.319
So, if I show you a ring signature,

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.959
it's a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof that I

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.430
have one of the private keys that belongs to the public key set,

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.219
but you have no proof about which one,

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:51.305
that information stays protected.

00:03:51.305 --> 00:03:54.844
There are lots of other zero-knowledge proving techniques.

00:03:54.844 --> 00:04:01.219
In the next concept, we'll discuss one of the more interesting ones called ZK snarks.
