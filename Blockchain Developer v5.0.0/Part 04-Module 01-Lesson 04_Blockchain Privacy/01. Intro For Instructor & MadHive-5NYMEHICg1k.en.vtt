00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.805
Hi, my name is Aaron Brown.

00:00:02.805 --> 00:00:05.714
I'll be your instructor for the lesson on blockchain privacy.

00:00:05.714 --> 00:00:07.139
Before we get started,

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:08.789
I'd like to quickly introduce myself.

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:11.014
I'm the chief scientist at Madhive.

00:00:11.015 --> 00:00:14.025
Madhive is an ad tech company based in New York City.

00:00:14.025 --> 00:00:16.230
Ad tech for those who are not familiar

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.185
is the science and infrastructural side of advertising.

00:00:19.184 --> 00:00:22.320
So, we work with things like really large datasets,

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.810
machine-learning and high performance computing.

00:00:24.809 --> 00:00:29.070
All this to make sure that billions of advertisements gets shown to the right people,

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.100
on the right device, at the right time every day.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.995
Ad tech has some pretty difficult problems to be solved.

00:00:34.994 --> 00:00:37.769
The first of which is a real lack of standards.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.135
It takes a surprisingly large number of companies to get one ad onto your screen.

00:00:42.134 --> 00:00:46.549
Without standards it's really difficult to get consensus about what happened to an ad.

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:50.404
With so many companies involved that leads to a lot of confusion about data

00:00:50.405 --> 00:00:52.579
and businesses suffer because of all that time they

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.354
spend reconciling data that costs money.

00:00:55.354 --> 00:00:58.414
We the consumer suffer because when the data is not right,

00:00:58.414 --> 00:01:00.500
you're probably getting shown a lot of ads that aren't

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.869
interesting to you, and that's annoying.

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:05.929
At the other end of the spectrum are companies that do a really,

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.080
really good job of organizing all the data about you.

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:12.484
They literally track your every move and know everything about you.

00:01:12.484 --> 00:01:15.079
That's dangerous because most consumers

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:17.334
don't realize the degree to which they're being tracked,

00:01:17.334 --> 00:01:22.039
and this data set is vulnerable to hacking and other kinds of exploitation.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.310
What ad tech needs is just basic accounting standards.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.730
Proving that data hasn't been changed and it's still valid.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.880
Cryptography is perfect for that,

00:01:30.879 --> 00:01:34.354
and privacy plays a huge role in making this possible.

00:01:34.355 --> 00:01:37.310
True privacy while maintaining certainty

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.189
and data wouldn't have been possible for blockchain.

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.379
So, that makes privacy the killer app for

00:01:42.379 --> 00:01:46.084
blockchain and at Madhive we're super excited to be a big part of that.

00:01:46.084 --> 00:01:49.219
Not only does this allow companies to collaborate together with

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:53.844
their data without anyone losing control and without anyone diluting its value,

00:01:53.844 --> 00:01:56.750
privacy allows them to advertise effectively while

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.109
keeping consumers information 100 percent secure.

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:03.230
I'll teach you some of the techniques we use here at Madhive.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.990
One of the things that's really exciting about working at

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:10.729
Madhive is how much we've been able to contribute back to the development of blockchains.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.729
We were the first big company in ad tech to get involved

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:17.854
seriously by building cool stuff and solving problems for everyone's benefit.

00:02:17.854 --> 00:02:20.989
These same ideas extend way beyond ad tech and

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.365
really help everybody working on the blockchain no matter what industry.

00:02:24.365 --> 00:02:27.260
Privacy is one of those big problems that needed

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:30.243
a solution before companies could do real advertising

00:02:30.243 --> 00:02:32.060
or really any kind of

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.935
large-scale collaborative work on a decentralized blockchain network.

00:02:36.935 --> 00:02:39.724
We're proud to be a privacy first company

00:02:39.724 --> 00:02:42.680
and leaders in defending data privacy for everyone.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.230
It's been really exciting to watch this technology grow

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:47.869
up and working with Udacity we hope to

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.355
help train and bring more talented engineers to this space and we're still discovering.

00:02:53.354 --> 00:02:56.299
Blockchain and privacy are definitely areas where

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.314
there are so many exciting and difficult problems to solve.

00:02:59.314 --> 00:03:03.669
Coming up, I'll introduce the core concepts we'll go over in this lesson.

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:08.379
Then we'll jump in, get started with this lesson on blockchain and privacy.
