00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
In this exercise, we are going to take your new-found knowledge of the checks,

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.144
effects, and interaction pattern and put it to use.

00:00:08.144 --> 00:00:10.334
Now in prior exercises,

00:00:10.335 --> 00:00:12.660
you have used an IDE,

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.429
you've used Truffle, grenache,

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.714
etc, and you'll do the same thing in future exercises too.

00:00:17.714 --> 00:00:20.515
But when covering our design patterns,

00:00:20.515 --> 00:00:23.990
it's important that you stay focused on the algorithm and not the

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:28.354
nuances of whether things compile or syntax and such.

00:00:28.355 --> 00:00:32.899
Therefore, for this exercise and for the other design patterns,

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.109
we're going to focus primarily on writing the code in

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:42.515
a plain text editor and not on compiling and testing the code etc.

00:00:42.515 --> 00:00:45.619
It's more important for us to focus on the algorithm.

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:49.429
But let's start with the exercise.

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:51.494
So using any text editor,

00:00:51.494 --> 00:00:56.299
write a function, safeWithdraw that takes one parameter,

00:00:56.299 --> 00:01:00.000
that's a uint256, and that protects against

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.280
re-entrancy attacks using the Checks-Effects-Interaction pattern.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.254
The requirements for the function are: first,

00:01:08.254 --> 00:01:18.323
verify the value of caller addresses in mapping address to uint256 called sales,

00:01:18.323 --> 00:01:21.829
and make sure that it's greater than or equal to 100.

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:24.200
So whoever the caller is,

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.140
you have to make sure that in the mapping sales,

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.094
the value is equal to or greater than 100.

00:01:30.094 --> 00:01:35.060
Next, you must verify that the caller has adequate funds to be withdrawn.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.730
You have to transfer the value of

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.615
that sales variable to the caller and the caller address.

00:01:42.614 --> 00:01:47.479
You have to reset the sales value to zero,

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.219
and last but not least,

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:53.674
you have to verify that the caller is an externally own account.

00:01:53.674 --> 00:01:56.959
Now the order of the requirements is not necessarily,

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:59.539
the order in which you will complete the exercise.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.089
Part of the exercises is understanding

00:02:02.088 --> 00:02:05.105
how these should be ordered to conform to the checks,

00:02:05.105 --> 00:02:07.445
effects, and interaction pattern.

00:02:07.444 --> 00:02:12.180
So create this function, safeWithdraw.
