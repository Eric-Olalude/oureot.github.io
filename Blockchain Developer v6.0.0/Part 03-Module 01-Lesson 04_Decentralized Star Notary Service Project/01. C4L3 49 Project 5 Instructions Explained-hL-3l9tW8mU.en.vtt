00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.865
This project is designed to help you practice

00:00:02.865 --> 00:00:06.150
all the tools that you have learned so far to create ADAP.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.860
I have helped you create version two of the Steiner tree smart contract.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.455
We have added functions to create a star,

00:00:13.455 --> 00:00:15.000
put a startup for sale,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.100
and also buy a star.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.980
In this project, I would like you to take this contract

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.205
a step further by implementing more functionality.

00:00:23.205 --> 00:00:28.395
I would like you to add functionality to give your star tokens a name and a symbol.

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:34.470
I would also like you to add functionality to exchange stars and also transfer stars.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.910
You will also write supporting test cases for this added functionality.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.965
You will add front-end features,

00:00:40.965 --> 00:00:43.155
interact with this newly added functions.

00:00:43.155 --> 00:00:45.664
Finally, I would also like you to deploy

00:00:45.664 --> 00:00:48.775
your smart contract to the public Rinkeby network.

00:00:48.775 --> 00:00:53.420
Once deployed, you would add your own ERC-721 star tokens

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.565
to your MetaMask wallet and transfer between various Rinkeby addresses.

00:00:58.565 --> 00:00:59.975
To submit your project,

00:00:59.975 --> 00:01:01.735
you need to submit your project files,

00:01:01.735 --> 00:01:03.690
you deployed token address,

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.230
and the Etherscan transaction ID for transferring tokens between addresses.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.480
Do contact us if you have any questions or if it gets stuck with this project,

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.440
we are here to help you.
