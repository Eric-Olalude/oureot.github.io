00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.970
In a Ethereum, transactions move the state of the account.

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:06.580
Their piece of instruction to submit to

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.004
the blockchain generated by an externally owned account.

00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:11.980
In this video, we'll go over

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.660
different transaction types that exist on the Ethereum network,

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.920
then, we'll overview the transaction fields in each of these types.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.035
There are two transaction types;

00:00:22.035 --> 00:00:24.594
message calls and contract creation.

00:00:24.594 --> 00:00:29.634
Externally owned accounts initiate both message calls and contract creation.

00:00:29.635 --> 00:00:35.814
This transaction could be between a person and another person or a person to a contract.

00:00:35.814 --> 00:00:40.354
Here's a diagram that shows each of these message types in a little more detail.

00:00:40.354 --> 00:00:42.625
On the left is a message call.

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:46.070
This message call results in a change to the world state.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.950
This state change could be as simple as a change in

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.590
Ethereum balance or a change in smart contract storage.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.520
To do this, the owner of an EOA signs

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.690
the transaction with their private key prior to sending it on the network.

00:00:59.689 --> 00:01:01.849
After making this message call,

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.099
it can trigger a message between EOAs and other EOAs,

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:07.384
or EOAs and CAs.

00:01:07.385 --> 00:01:09.905
Contract creation is a little simpler.

00:01:09.905 --> 00:01:11.780
This also results in a change to

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.534
the world state and is specifically used to create contracts.

00:01:15.534 --> 00:01:18.140
The type of transaction you create is determined

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.825
by the values in each of the contract fields.

00:01:20.825 --> 00:01:23.885
Here's an example of an Ethereum transaction.

00:01:23.885 --> 00:01:29.375
First, notice that there are a few fields like nonce, gasPrice and others.

00:01:29.375 --> 00:01:32.599
Let's go over these fields in a little more detail.

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:37.054
First, the nonce is a transaction count from the sender's account.

00:01:37.055 --> 00:01:41.595
Every transaction that occurs needs to have a unique incrementing nonce.

00:01:41.594 --> 00:01:45.359
The first transaction you send from your account will have a nonce of zero,

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:48.579
the second will have a nonce of one, and so on.

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:54.394
Next, the gas price is the price the sender is willing to pay per unit of gas.

00:01:54.394 --> 00:01:57.984
We'll be covering gas in a little more detail in the next section,

00:01:57.984 --> 00:02:02.245
but the gas price is a similar concept to [inaudible] and Bitcoin.

00:02:02.245 --> 00:02:07.715
Ethereum uses gas to determine the reward miners received for executing contracts,

00:02:07.715 --> 00:02:12.705
the price set here is the incentive miners have to mine new transactions.

00:02:12.705 --> 00:02:17.665
The gas limit specifies the maximum number of gas that the contract can spend.

00:02:17.664 --> 00:02:21.634
This is useful for a few reasons that we'll go over it in a later section.

00:02:21.634 --> 00:02:26.250
Next, the To field is where you specify a recipient address.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.039
The amount of Ether you want to send is shown in the value field.

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:32.629
This value is written in way.

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:36.204
Finally, the data in Init fields are optional.

00:02:36.205 --> 00:02:38.930
But are what make Ethereum different from other platforms?

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.900
Here, you can provide information used to record

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.795
the creation and execution of smart contracts.

00:02:44.794 --> 00:02:48.069
This field is used when interacting with smart contracts.

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.489
It will hold the code that lists conditions and consequences of the contract.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.020
That wraps up this brief introduction to transaction types and their fields.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.280
We'll actually be using these fields soon when we start creating our own transactions.
