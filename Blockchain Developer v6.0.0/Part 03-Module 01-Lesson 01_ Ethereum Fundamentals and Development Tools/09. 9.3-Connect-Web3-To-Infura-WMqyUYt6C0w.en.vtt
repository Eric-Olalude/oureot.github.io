00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.254
At this point, you're hopefully setup with an Infura account.

00:00:03.254 --> 00:00:05.160
To connect Infura to Web3,

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.015
you'll just need to set up the connection to the endpoint provided on your dashboard.

00:00:09.015 --> 00:00:11.220
That endpoint is provided here.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.339
You can choose different networks if you'd like from the drop-down,

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:16.769
but we'll be connecting to the main network.

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:19.350
Next, you'll need to go back to your terminal.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.179
If you left your project folder,

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:24.884
you'll need to set up a new project as shown earlier using npm init,

00:00:24.885 --> 00:00:26.995
saving Web3 as the dependency,

00:00:26.995 --> 00:00:28.955
and entering your node console.

00:00:28.954 --> 00:00:33.409
I've done that already and I also have Web3 required into my project.

00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:39.294
For the next step, create a variable named URL and set it equal to the Infura endpoint.

00:00:39.295 --> 00:00:42.615
Now, we'll create a new variable named web3 with

00:00:42.615 --> 00:00:47.765
a lowercase w and set it equal to a new Web3 that points to this URL.

00:00:47.765 --> 00:00:51.410
This is all it takes to make the connection between Web3 and Infura.

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:54.364
Call the variable to see if the connection you made is working.

00:00:54.365 --> 00:00:58.490
If it is, you should get data back that looks like this. So, that's easy.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.670
You're all set up. Now, you can make calls to

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.200
a remote node using the Infura API that's connected to your Web3.
