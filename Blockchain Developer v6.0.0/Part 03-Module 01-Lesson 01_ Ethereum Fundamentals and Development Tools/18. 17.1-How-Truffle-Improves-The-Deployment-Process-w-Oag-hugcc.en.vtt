00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
Deploying from tools like Remix can be easy in some ways but limiting in others.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.110
While this is a great way to get started with new ideas,

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.335
you'll eventually want to get rid of some of the headaches that come up from using them.

00:00:10.335 --> 00:00:14.580
For one, if you practice deploying from your local environment using Remix enough,

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.905
you'll get tired of the pattern of deploying,

00:00:16.905 --> 00:00:18.405
copying the ABI over,

00:00:18.405 --> 00:00:20.190
copying the contract address over,

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.065
and other repetitive tasks.

00:00:22.065 --> 00:00:25.350
For this and many other reasons that you'll learn to love overtime,

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.300
the Truffle framework was created.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.535
The Truffle framework is a suite of tools

00:00:29.535 --> 00:00:31.965
meant to help improve your life as a DApp developer.

00:00:31.965 --> 00:00:34.140
Right away, something should look pretty familiar.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.400
Ganache is here. Ganache is one tool from within the Truffle framework.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.600
So, if Ganache is just a side project,

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.535
imagine how helpful the core tool in this framework will be.

00:00:43.535 --> 00:00:46.775
As it says, Truffle is a world-class development environment,

00:00:46.775 --> 00:00:49.595
testing framework, and asset pipeline for blockchains.

00:00:49.595 --> 00:00:52.040
You'll get into the testing and asset management soon,

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.860
but to start we'll focus on the development environment.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.075
Below the video, I linked the homepage,

00:00:57.075 --> 00:01:00.890
the GitHub page, and the Gitter page you can use to get involved with the community.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.960
Take some time to look through these if you'd like,

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.440
then continue through this concept to see how to get started for yourself.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.420
This is a great tool we'll start to use

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.895
a lot alongside other tools you've learned so far.

00:01:10.895 --> 00:01:14.930
Remix, Infura, Ganache, and other tools are still totally relevant.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.530
This is just another way to make your developer experience even better.
