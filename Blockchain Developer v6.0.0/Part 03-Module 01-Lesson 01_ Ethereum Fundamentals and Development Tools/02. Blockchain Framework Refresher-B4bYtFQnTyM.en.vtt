00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.705
Before getting into Ethereum,

00:00:01.705 --> 00:00:04.984
we wanted to give you a quick refresher on the block chain framework.

00:00:04.985 --> 00:00:06.890
This was covered in earlier lessons,

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:08.365
when we spoke about Bitcoin,

00:00:08.365 --> 00:00:12.085
and we'll also anchor us as we progress through the Ethereum world.

00:00:12.085 --> 00:00:16.650
As you'll see, there are many similarities between these two block chains,

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:18.479
and a lot of your previous knowledge,

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.905
will be directly applicable as we explore the theorem.

00:00:21.905 --> 00:00:26.054
Here's a quick recap on the list of components from the block chain framework.

00:00:26.054 --> 00:00:28.769
In this video, we'll walk through the framework,

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.439
to make sure you are familiar with each of these steps,

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.450
and how they relate to one another.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.750
First, transactions.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.134
These are the basic atomic units of work,

00:00:38.134 --> 00:00:40.129
submitted by a user to a node,

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.125
to be included in the next block.

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:45.755
Next, the wallet, which contains a wallet address.

00:00:45.755 --> 00:00:49.130
The wallet address is like an email address that you share with others,

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.315
should you want them to send you crypto-currencies like Bitcoin,

00:00:52.314 --> 00:00:53.974
Ethereum, and many more.

00:00:53.975 --> 00:00:58.609
Users send transactions to one another using Wallet addresses.

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:01.195
Before the network validates a transaction,

00:01:01.195 --> 00:01:02.715
it needs a signature.

00:01:02.715 --> 00:01:05.120
A signature is the process by which one

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.090
signs the transactions before submitting to the node,

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.005
for inclusion into the next block.

00:01:10.004 --> 00:01:13.369
After signing, the transactions enter the Mempool.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.250
This is where all unconfirmed transactions are placed,

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.215
until mining nodes validate these transactions.

00:01:19.215 --> 00:01:24.055
All transactions in the Mempool are waiting to be picked up by a node in the network.

00:01:24.055 --> 00:01:26.509
This network is distributed in nature,

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:29.420
where everyone is able to download a copy of the ledger,

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.725
to their local computer.

00:01:30.724 --> 00:01:32.089
This makes it so,

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.058
that there's no centralized ownership of information,

00:01:35.058 --> 00:01:39.914
and allows the network to determine which transactions are valid, and which are not.

00:01:39.915 --> 00:01:44.490
The network achieves consensus by determining which transactions are valid.

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:47.359
Consensus is the name for a group of

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:50.689
algorithms that can be used to create a voting mechanism,

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:53.310
or process for a given block chain network.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.924
We've gone over some of these algorithms earlier;

00:01:55.924 --> 00:01:59.075
like proof of Work, proof of Stake, but there are many more.

00:01:59.075 --> 00:02:01.070
Once the network agrees,

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:04.799
transaction is placed in a block and hash is assigned.

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.544
Hashing is a process of generating a digital fingerprint,

00:02:08.544 --> 00:02:09.739
also known as hash,

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.185
by passing data or information to a hashing function.

00:02:13.185 --> 00:02:15.400
This helped us identify a block,

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.515
and know whether or not the information has been tampered with.

00:02:18.514 --> 00:02:20.750
If information has been changed,

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.429
the hash will also change,

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:24.175
which invalidates the block.

00:02:24.175 --> 00:02:30.050
A block is a container that holds a list of transactions to be added to the block chain.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.535
Finally, these blocks are linked together using hash values,

00:02:34.534 --> 00:02:36.745
into what we call the block chain.

00:02:36.745 --> 00:02:41.259
This block chain is a shared ledger where the blocks are chained together.

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:46.149
It contains the entire history of transactions that have been made on the block chain.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.500
This allows us to easily see which transactions are valid and not.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.995
So, there's a couple of components we went over before in the block chain framework.

00:02:54.995 --> 00:02:59.569
Moving forward, we'll see that all of this is very similar in a theorem.

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.659
That said, there are some important differences.

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:05.419
Coming up, we'll go over some new terminologies

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:08.000
to better understand what these differences are.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.159
This will help us as we transition into building our own Ethereum based applications.
