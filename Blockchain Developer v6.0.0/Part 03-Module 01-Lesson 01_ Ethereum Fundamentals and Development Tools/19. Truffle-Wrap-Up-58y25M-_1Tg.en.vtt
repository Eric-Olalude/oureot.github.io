00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.555
Rather than going back to the secret message tab we've been working on,

00:00:03.555 --> 00:00:06.075
I wanted to show you something that I think you might enjoy.

00:00:06.075 --> 00:00:08.070
Truffle has a lot of cool features,

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.474
and along with that, they also have a lot of supporting tools you can use.

00:00:11.474 --> 00:00:14.399
One of these tools is known as a Truffle Box.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.339
Truffle boxes are helpful boilerplates that can get

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:20.594
you up and running with the Truffle environment as quickly as possible.

00:00:20.594 --> 00:00:24.929
As you saw before, "Truffle in it" is one way to start a blank environment.

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:29.295
But Truffle Boxes come along with the full DApp that you can use to experiment with.

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:33.390
For example, the first one I ever did was the Pet Shop DApp.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.859
You can find that here. It's a quick way to get up and running with the simple Pet Shop.

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:39.689
By clicking on the Truffle Box,

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:41.324
they'll show you how to get started,

00:00:41.325 --> 00:00:43.075
and by clicking on the tutorial,

00:00:43.075 --> 00:00:44.810
you'll see a really well-prepared set of

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.375
documentation that walks you through the creation,

00:00:47.375 --> 00:00:50.405
testing, and deployment of your own Pet Shop.

00:00:50.405 --> 00:00:53.554
What's great about this and other tutorials is that,

00:00:53.554 --> 00:00:55.670
yes you can mess around with the look, feel,

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.350
and functionality of the DApp,

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.480
but with a little creativity you can

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:02.029
turn these DApps into something completely different.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.260
For example, this Pet Shop allows you to adopt from a list of pets,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.525
but if you think about it that's a feature

00:01:08.525 --> 00:01:11.609
that lets you claim ownership over anything at all.

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:13.450
By replacing some images,

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.695
and a few lines of code,

00:01:14.694 --> 00:01:16.939
you can have yourself in online card shop,

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:20.185
a clothing store, or even a music company.

00:01:20.185 --> 00:01:23.540
Another box I personally like is the tutorial token,

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.775
which helps you build your very own tokens.

00:01:25.775 --> 00:01:28.910
Aside from that, there's boxes that helped get you up and running

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.670
with full-stack applications using different frameworks.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.085
Are you a fan of React?

00:01:33.084 --> 00:01:34.625
There's a box for that here.

00:01:34.625 --> 00:01:37.489
There's actually a ton of boxes for React you can try.

00:01:37.489 --> 00:01:39.545
I've found a few for Vue.js too,

00:01:39.545 --> 00:01:42.019
but I don't see that many for Angular yet.

00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:44.134
There's also a box for drizzle,

00:01:44.135 --> 00:01:46.175
another tool in the Truffle suite.

00:01:46.174 --> 00:01:48.814
I honestly haven't experimented with this much myself,

00:01:48.814 --> 00:01:50.164
but if you find it useful,

00:01:50.165 --> 00:01:51.935
it'd be really cool to hear about it.

00:01:51.935 --> 00:01:55.250
Here's a practice I think it would be really valuable for you to try.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.310
It was definitely helpful for me.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.144
Try the Pet Shop DApp,

00:01:59.144 --> 00:02:03.259
and at that point you'll have a full-stack DApp that you can launch to the test network.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.600
Then, take a different simple DApp.

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:08.939
In your case, maybe the theorem secret message DApp.

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:12.379
From there, strip out all the features specific to a pet shop,

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.664
and replace it with the functionality of the secret message DApp.

00:02:15.664 --> 00:02:18.469
What you'll end up with is a DApp that you can deploy from

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:21.289
Truffle with the added functionality of the pet shop,

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:23.719
and you'll have an understanding of how the pieces

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:26.479
fit together to make something entirely your own.

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:29.030
Honestly, building this combo DApp is

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.865
exactly what I was going to make this concept about originally.

00:02:31.865 --> 00:02:34.245
What I found though, is that by doing it myself,

00:02:34.245 --> 00:02:35.520
I learned a ton more,

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.405
got to explore things in new ways,

00:02:37.405 --> 00:02:40.009
and ended up with something I was really happy with.

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:42.620
Well, I'm not walking you through the process here.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.840
I'm really hoping that this gives you the opportunity to

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.509
dive into the details you may have overlooked otherwise,

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:50.599
and helps you become an even better developer because of it.

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:52.155
Remember, along the way,

00:02:52.155 --> 00:02:53.629
you can always check out their docs,

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:55.685
tutorials, blog, and community,

00:02:55.685 --> 00:02:57.140
to help you as you get started.

00:02:57.139 --> 00:02:59.000
Finally, to wrap things up,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.754
there's one more thing I wanted to mention.

00:03:00.754 --> 00:03:03.155
Keep an eye out for the Truffle five beta.

00:03:03.155 --> 00:03:05.750
I placed a link below to its documentation,

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.449
and you can get up and running with it right now if you'd like.

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:11.344
I started using it myself, and I think it's great.

00:03:11.344 --> 00:03:14.359
I didn't introduce it earlier because you're not yet going to find

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.315
a ton of resources available to help you get started.

00:03:17.314 --> 00:03:21.875
Almost all the tutorials online aren't using this version because it's still pretty new.

00:03:21.875 --> 00:03:23.990
But if you'd like to get ahead of everyone,

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.730
you can jump in now, and see which of these features they have that interest you.

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:30.859
Hopefully you see this as a great chance to learn more about Truffle.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.820
We'll be using this a lot more in the future,

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.129
and I'm excited to see what you end up building with it.
