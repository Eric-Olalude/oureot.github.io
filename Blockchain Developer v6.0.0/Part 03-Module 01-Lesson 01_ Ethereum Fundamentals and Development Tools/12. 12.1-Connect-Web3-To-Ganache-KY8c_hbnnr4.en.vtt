00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.790
Now that you've got a local blockchain,

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.920
let's connect to it using Web3.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.470
Once you do, you'll be able to read data from it the

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.170
same as you did with the main and test networks before.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.650
On top of that, you'll be able to make transactions between your accounts to

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.490
test out your new ideas without worrying about the amount of Ether you spent.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.655
The process is almost exactly like what we did before,

00:00:20.655 --> 00:00:23.190
but we'll be changing our URL to the one Ganache

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.755
provides rather than the one given by Infura.

00:00:25.755 --> 00:00:27.825
So, hopefully this feels familiar,

00:00:27.825 --> 00:00:30.990
but I'll walk you through the full process to help you get through it.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.100
First, I'll make a project folder and change into it.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.160
From there, I'll initialize npm.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.575
This time I'll add -y so that I don't need to run through all those questions again.

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:44.405
I'll only need the defaults for now,

00:00:44.405 --> 00:00:48.325
and adding this -y accepts all the defaults for me.

00:00:48.325 --> 00:00:52.540
Next, I'll install Web3 as a dependency.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.060
Open node in your terminal.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.905
From here, I just need to make the connection to Web3 like before.

00:01:02.905 --> 00:01:06.860
The difference is I'll set the URL equal to the one provided by Ganache.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.720
To open the graphic user interface,

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.775
just click on the app and it will load up.

00:01:10.775 --> 00:01:16.160
To open the CLI, go to a separate terminal window and type ganache-cli.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.680
Once it's running, I'll go back to my main terminal.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.325
First, set a variable Web3 equal to requiring Web3.

00:01:24.325 --> 00:01:27.355
Next, go get the URL to connect to.

00:01:27.355 --> 00:01:29.575
In the Ganache graphic user interface,

00:01:29.575 --> 00:01:32.390
you'll see that the connection is ending in 7545,

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.630
but that in the CLI, it's ending in 8545.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.370
Whichever version you decide on,

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.855
just make sure you're connected to the right URL as shown here.

00:01:40.855 --> 00:01:47.375
To make the connection, I'll say var Web3 equals new Web3 followed by my URL.

00:01:47.375 --> 00:01:51.620
You can set the URL equal to a variable and then pass that in like we did before,

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.350
but this is fine too.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.165
So, if this worked out right,

00:01:55.165 --> 00:01:58.325
you're now connected to your local blockchain from Web3.

00:01:58.325 --> 00:02:02.315
To check, you can call Web3 and you should see something like this.

00:02:02.315 --> 00:02:04.220
That's just some data about your connection

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.530
similar to when you connect it to the main network.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.389
That's great, but it's more fun to read

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:10.579
some useful data from the blockchain you're connected to.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.920
To start, you can list all of the accounts using

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.115
the getAccounts function from the web3.eth module.

00:02:16.115 --> 00:02:20.645
I'll do that then use.then to console.log their results just like before.

00:02:20.645 --> 00:02:23.495
There's the 10 accounts I have on my local blockchain.

00:02:23.495 --> 00:02:25.205
You can check to make sure.

00:02:25.205 --> 00:02:29.180
This first account it returns is the same as the one in my graphic user interface,

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.800
and the rest are the same too.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.810
Perfect. If you made it this far,

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.120
you're now connected to your graphic user interface or

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.130
CLI version of the blockchain using Web3.
