00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.205
As you've seen, there are many similarities and differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum.

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:07.890
At this point, it's helpful to compare them to get

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:10.855
a better idea of how each of these platforms operate.

00:00:10.855 --> 00:00:13.075
In this video, we'll walk through a table,

00:00:13.074 --> 00:00:15.769
comparing and contrasting Bitcoin with Ethereum,

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:18.120
across a few of their core attributes.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.009
We'll look at things like, permissions,

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:22.530
scalability, currencies, and more.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:28.425
Let's get started. First, both Bitcoin and Ethereum have permissionless restrictions.

00:00:28.425 --> 00:00:32.454
That means that anyone who wants to validate transactions and create blocks,

00:00:32.454 --> 00:00:37.655
can do this, there's no restrictions on becoming a part of either of these networks.

00:00:37.655 --> 00:00:40.454
This is different from a permission system.

00:00:40.454 --> 00:00:42.079
In a permission system,

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.179
notes would need permission from a central authority to join the network.

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:49.429
Networks achieve consensus in each of these platforms,

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:51.835
using the Proof of Work algorithm.

00:00:51.835 --> 00:00:55.310
Ethereum is currently working on migrating to Proof of Stake,

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.344
with a project known as Casper.

00:00:57.344 --> 00:00:59.149
We'll highlight this more later,

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:01.869
but for now, they're both using Proof of Work.

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:05.599
Next, the scalability of these platforms are similar.

00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:09.629
Because of this, they share both upsides and downsides with each other.

00:01:09.629 --> 00:01:12.019
Allowing anyone to join the network is great

00:01:12.019 --> 00:01:14.739
for scaling the user base and expanding quickly.

00:01:14.739 --> 00:01:18.649
That said, both platforms struggle to scale performance.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.320
Figuring out how to do this is a huge discussion taking place in both communities.

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:27.604
For comparison, Bitcoin takes about 10 minutes to settle a transaction,

00:01:27.605 --> 00:01:30.260
and Ethereum takes about 15 seconds.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.370
That might seem like a huge improvement,

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.025
but let's compare that to Visa and MasterCard.

00:01:35.025 --> 00:01:38.540
These process about 5,000 transactions per second.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.555
With that in mind, you can see there's still a lot of room for improvement.

00:01:42.555 --> 00:01:45.830
Next, let's look at the regulation of the protocol.

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:49.579
By this, we mean the way decisions get made within the community.

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:54.000
Bitcoin and Ethereum both have improvement proposal systems in place.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.890
Because of this, they're able to work with both an open source community,

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.650
as well as a core set of developers,

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.285
to contribute to its developing ecosystem.

00:02:02.284 --> 00:02:04.909
This means, there's a huge opportunity for you to

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.920
get involved in these platforms to help them improve.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.015
Both of these platforms are pseudoanonymous,

00:02:11.014 --> 00:02:14.619
this means that their identities are tied to their public keys.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.270
So, while transactions are still anonymous,

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.370
they're not completely anonymous.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.710
It's possible to see who made a transaction,

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.515
if you can trace the user to their public key.

00:02:24.514 --> 00:02:29.229
Each of these platforms also have a native currency, Bitcoin and Ether.

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:32.139
This isn't always the case with other platforms.

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:35.319
In some cases, a platform won't have any currency,

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:36.519
or they could have a token,

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.500
that's dependent on a platform like Ethereum, to operate.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.274
Finally, the potential for scripting is different between each of these platforms.

00:02:44.274 --> 00:02:46.419
This is the main focus of these lessons,

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:48.719
so we won't go into too much detail here.

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:51.025
The languages provided by Ethereum,

00:02:51.025 --> 00:02:55.075
like Solidity, are the basis for smart contracts that we'll be developing.

00:02:55.074 --> 00:02:58.119
While Bitcoin does have some scripting functionality,

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.085
it's not as capable as Ethereum in the sense.

00:03:01.085 --> 00:03:05.745
All right. So that finishes up this side-by-side comparison of these platforms.

00:03:05.745 --> 00:03:09.025
As you can see, they're actually more similar than they are different.

00:03:09.025 --> 00:03:11.580
Some of the main differences are their scripting,

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.743
currencies, and in the future of their consensus algorithms.

00:03:14.743 --> 00:03:17.909
Keep this in mind as you continue to learn more about Ethereum.

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:21.740
Working through these new tools and ecosystems can get pretty complicated.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.219
Being able to relate this new information to ideas you already know,

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:28.319
will give you a great start as you continue learning.
