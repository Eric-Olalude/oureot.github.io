00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.669
We know a wallet can help us make transactions and it can manage many transactions,

00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:11.055
how do we ensure that we can trust a transaction that is listed in our wallet?

00:00:11.055 --> 00:00:13.960
This is done using a signature.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.040
A digital signature establishes a proof of

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.045
ownership for each transaction on the blockchain.

00:00:20.045 --> 00:00:25.175
Earlier, we discussed wallet types and management of private and public keys.

00:00:25.175 --> 00:00:28.910
We discussed the process used to secure wallet address ownership,

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.355
the various ways to manage

00:00:30.355 --> 00:00:34.160
private and public keys and how this relates to wallet security.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.415
We also discussed how the wallet process establishes trust.

00:00:38.415 --> 00:00:42.420
Wallets however are only a part of the equation.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.685
We must also ensure that transactions are secure.

00:00:45.685 --> 00:00:49.130
Why would somebody trusts a transaction on the blockchain?

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.040
The transaction starts broadcasting to the network

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.970
when a wallet first signs the transaction.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.310
Like a pen and paper check,

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.490
Bitcoin requires a signature from

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.975
the sender before the transaction is submitted to the network.

00:01:02.975 --> 00:01:06.269
In Bitcoin, this is done using a digital signature.

00:01:06.269 --> 00:01:11.310
So, how does this proof of ownership help establish security on the blockchain?

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.980
Well, imagine if sending Bitcoin were easy as sending an email,

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.960
what's stopping a thief from sending your Bitcoin to other people?

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.090
That's what signatures are for.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.960
They ensure that it's actually you who's sending Bitcoin

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.140
by signing the transaction with your own personal identity.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.200
This signature is created using a Bitcoin wallet address.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.300
The wallet address is similar to a bank account number.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.225
It's a unique address that belongs to you.

00:01:39.225 --> 00:01:42.145
This wallet address is linked to a private key.

00:01:42.145 --> 00:01:45.570
So, instead of a signature on a paper check,

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.080
you'll use your private key to perform a transaction.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.030
Once a transaction is signed,

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.675
it goes from the sender to the receiver as a transaction message.

00:01:55.675 --> 00:01:59.625
In Bitcoin, the transaction message is broadcasted to the chain

00:01:59.625 --> 00:02:04.210
as an unspent transaction output known as UTXO.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:11.855
Only these unspent transaction outputs can be used as inputs to an accepted transaction.

00:02:11.855 --> 00:02:15.575
Each of these unspent transaction output contains conditions

00:02:15.575 --> 00:02:19.250
regarding the proof of ownership to transact with those funds.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.345
These proofs of ownership are derived from your private key.

00:02:23.345 --> 00:02:27.725
Let's break this down by starting with transaction inputs.

00:02:27.725 --> 00:02:30.800
Transaction inputs are considered inbound

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.440
payments that contribute to funding your wallet.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:41.005
Imagine, you have a wallet with a zero balance and want to send Bitcoin to your friend.

00:02:41.005 --> 00:02:45.265
The first problem you'll encounter is a lack of funds.

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:52.645
You'll need to fund your wallet and perform a transfer of value using transaction inputs.

00:02:52.645 --> 00:02:54.395
To get these funds,

00:02:54.395 --> 00:02:58.430
you can obtain them from several sources at different times.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.955
Each transaction that is transferred to

00:03:00.955 --> 00:03:04.150
your wallet is considered a new transaction input.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.715
Each transaction input has a condition.

00:03:06.715 --> 00:03:10.240
The transaction input will need to be converted to

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.000
an output which contains the condition to prove ownership using your private key.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.780
With your private key, you can sign your transaction with

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.605
your digital signature proving you own the address containing the transaction inputs.

00:03:24.605 --> 00:03:29.450
A wallet must contain funds to be able to produce valid transaction outputs.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.930
This allows you to transfer value on the blockchain to your friend.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.870
Let's imagine that your wallet obtained

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.780
three transaction inputs with the following values 0.25,

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.690
0.45, 0.33 of a Bitcoin,

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.590
your wallet is now worth 1.03 Bitcoin.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.374
All right. If you obtain three transaction inputs,

00:03:53.374 --> 00:03:56.890
creating a total value of 1.03 Bitcoin,

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.530
how do we make sure to pay your friend,

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:05.885
pay the transaction fee and obtain 0.027 bitcoin change back?

00:04:05.885 --> 00:04:10.950
Now, that's a great question and is the idea behind transaction outputs.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.280
To create a transaction output,

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.825
you need to have the sum of the transaction inputs

00:04:16.825 --> 00:04:20.815
which are equal to or greater than the value you are sending,

00:04:20.815 --> 00:04:25.315
Next, we will include the miners fee into the outbound transaction.

00:04:25.315 --> 00:04:29.390
Remember, that miners transaction fees motivates miners

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.805
on the network to include your transaction into the next block on the chain.

00:04:33.805 --> 00:04:39.620
Basically, any amount greater than one bitcoin will go to the miners transaction fee.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.640
Depending on the organization of your transaction inputs,

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.360
you might be transmitting more value than you prefer.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.260
In the case of you sending one Bitcoin to your friend,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.555
you would expect to get changed back.

00:04:53.555 --> 00:04:55.830
Good news, we can do that.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.050
Just like the way we created a transaction from you to your friend,

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.895
we could create a new transaction including

00:05:02.895 --> 00:05:06.055
outputs for change to be returned back to you.

00:05:06.055 --> 00:05:11.860
Here, you would create a transaction output,1.003 to your friend.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:17.075
This output includes miners transaction fees of 0.003.

00:05:17.075 --> 00:05:21.000
The remainder of your input transaction will now be configured as

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.610
a new output for change which will return 0.027 Bitcoin back to your wallet.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.715
Now that we understand how a transaction works,

00:05:29.715 --> 00:05:33.135
utilizing you UTXO, the next step is to

00:05:33.135 --> 00:05:36.965
transmit this transaction be included in the blockchain mempool.

00:05:36.965 --> 00:05:40.165
To recap, you learn the purpose of proving

00:05:40.165 --> 00:05:44.170
address ownership by signing a transaction with your private key.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:50.655
Finally, you learned how transaction inputs and outputs have conditions called proofs.

00:05:50.655 --> 00:05:54.890
These proofs are valid unspent transaction outputs known

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:59.895
as UTXO to transfer value from one wallet address to another.

00:05:59.895 --> 00:06:02.910
These are all extremely important concepts that allow

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.600
users to trust a transaction on the blockchain.
