00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.270
All right. We've covered a tone of information and congratulations on getting this far.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.930
In this video, we'll walk through the blockchain transaction lifecycle.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.950
This lifecycle follows the journey of a single transaction as it

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.355
works its way through each stage in the process towards joining the blockchain.

00:00:18.355 --> 00:00:22.330
This will bring everything together that we've learned so far and

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.040
establish a framework that we can use to understand the entire process.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.760
Keep in mind everything that you've learned throughout the previous lessons,

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.240
because this lifecycle spans all of it.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.055
This will hopefully provide some clarity on how all the pieces fit together.

00:00:38.055 --> 00:00:43.380
Here's what the lifecycle looks like between two BitCoin users, Joe and Brandy.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.450
In this example, Joe wants to send one Bitcoin to Brandy.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.475
First, Joe gets Brady's wallet address.

00:00:50.475 --> 00:00:54.905
Using this information, he creates a new transaction for one Bitcoin

00:00:54.905 --> 00:00:59.920
from his wallet and includes a transaction fee of 0.003 Bitcoins.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.545
Next, he verifies his information and sends the transaction.

00:01:04.545 --> 00:01:08.040
His wallet starts the transaction signing algorithm

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.995
which signs his transaction using his private key.

00:01:10.995 --> 00:01:15.810
The transaction is now broadcasted to the memory pool within the network.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.265
This transaction is eventually accepted by the miners.

00:01:19.265 --> 00:01:22.490
These miners group this transaction into a block,

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.400
find the proof of work and assign this block a hash value.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.530
This block is now placed onto the blockchain.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.870
As this block gains confirmations,

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.200
it is accepted as a valid transaction in the network.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.530
Once the transaction is accepted,

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.730
Brandy finally gets her Bitcoin.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.340
If you understood most of all of that,

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.370
you've come in an enormous way towards understanding the blockchain.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.850
This concise summary obviously doesn't include all the details,

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.250
but acts as a quick story that you can use to branch

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.625
off into more of the details we discussed through the lesson.

00:01:54.625 --> 00:01:57.240
Congratulations again on getting this far.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.785
We'll definitely be using all of this as we dive

00:01:59.785 --> 00:02:03.140
deeper into each of these concepts later on.
