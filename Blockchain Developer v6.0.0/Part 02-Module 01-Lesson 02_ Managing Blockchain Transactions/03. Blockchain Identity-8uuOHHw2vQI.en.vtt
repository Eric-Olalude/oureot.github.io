00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.725
In this video, we'll learn some more about transactions.

00:00:04.725 --> 00:00:06.530
We'll discuss two things.

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:13.590
First, we want it so that only someone who owns the money has access to spend it.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.120
Next, we'll want it so that our transactions cannot be traced.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.780
And finally, it should also be possible to share

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.620
this identity with others so that they can make transactions with you.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.915
This is all solved in Bitcoin using what's known as a Bitcoin Wallet.

00:00:31.915 --> 00:00:34.860
A Bitcoin Wallet establishes our identity on

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.435
the Blockchain and ensures we're able to do all the things we mentioned above,

00:00:39.435 --> 00:00:41.935
it does this using private keys,

00:00:41.935 --> 00:00:44.725
public keys and wallet addresses.

00:00:44.725 --> 00:00:48.520
All three of these things are items contained within our wallet.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.320
Let's go over some details of each of these.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.985
A Wallet Address or address is a unique identifier for your wallet.

00:00:56.985 --> 00:01:00.390
This address is a way to identify the owner of

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.725
a wallet that we can share with others to send and receive Bitcoin.

00:01:04.725 --> 00:01:08.160
But wait, we've seen the details of each transactions

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.765
added to the blockchain including things like wallet addresses,

00:01:11.765 --> 00:01:15.815
since we know that the purpose of the blockchain is to be secure,

00:01:15.815 --> 00:01:20.920
it seems strange that we have our private information available for everyone to see.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.480
We need to make sure transactions made with

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.125
his address are secure and can't be traced back to us,

00:01:27.125 --> 00:01:29.830
the good news is, it can't.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.560
But to understand why, we need to take a step back a bit,

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.930
the reason an address cannot be traced is because of how it's created.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.910
It goes through a bit of a journey starting with

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.470
private keys and ending with a wallet address that you can share with anyone.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.845
Let's start with private keys,

00:01:47.845 --> 00:01:50.950
a private key also known as a secret key,

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.230
is a secret number that allows you to spend your bitcoin from your wallet.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.365
These are randomly generated numbers that your wallet creates.

00:01:59.365 --> 00:02:02.070
Wallets can contain one or more of

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.445
these private keys and these should not be shared with anyone.

00:02:05.445 --> 00:02:09.765
Please be very careful with your private keys once you get started with your wallet.

00:02:09.765 --> 00:02:15.260
The next step is to turn this completely secret private key into a public key.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.830
A public key is derived from a private key and gives you

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.445
a publicly shareable key that cannot be used to spend bitcoin,

00:02:24.445 --> 00:02:27.670
you can share these public keys with anyone and

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.890
don't need to worry about people accessing your bitcoin.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.535
What they can use this for is to send you bitcoin.

00:02:34.535 --> 00:02:39.175
Public keys aren't randomly generated numbers like private keys are,

00:02:39.175 --> 00:02:43.255
they are created using private keys in a secure algorithm.

00:02:43.255 --> 00:02:47.740
Public and private Keys have an interesting relationship to one another,

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.910
we can share our public key without worrying about the security of our private key.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.280
Also, the private key has to be linked to the public key,

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.645
so that the private key can track the public key.

00:03:00.645 --> 00:03:05.475
This is really interesting problem to solve with a pretty cool solution.

00:03:05.475 --> 00:03:10.875
To do this, we use an algorithm that can create a public key using our private key.

00:03:10.875 --> 00:03:13.945
But after creating the public key,

00:03:13.945 --> 00:03:18.875
it shouldn't be possible to figure out what the original private key was.

00:03:18.875 --> 00:03:22.820
That way we can share our public key with others to receive

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.485
money without worrying that they'll later be able to spend money from our wallet.

00:03:27.485 --> 00:03:30.410
Bitcoin does this with an algorithm known as

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.885
a one-way Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm, ECDSA.

00:03:35.885 --> 00:03:40.800
This algorithm takes in a private key and creates a public key.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.950
A one-way algorithm is a term used for

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.970
any algorithm that's simple to execute in one direction,

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.770
but that's very difficult to reverse back to the original information.

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.110
In this case, the algorithm can easily create a public key,

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.210
but given that public key it's extremely

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.430
difficult to figure out what the private key was.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.455
This allows us to hand out public keys safely while

00:04:04.455 --> 00:04:09.285
our wallets track transactions using our private public key combinations.

00:04:09.285 --> 00:04:12.150
Since this algorithm is so difficult to reverse,

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.780
anyone with our public key won't be able to figure out our private key.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.000
So, this solves one big problem,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.880
we have a key that's safe to share but there's another problem,

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.680
this public key can still be traced.
