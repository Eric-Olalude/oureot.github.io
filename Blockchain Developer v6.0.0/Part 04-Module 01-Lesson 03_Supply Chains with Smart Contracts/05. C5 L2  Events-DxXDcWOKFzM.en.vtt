00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In this section, let us define some events.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.695
Events can be emitted by functions when a specific action is performed.

00:00:07.695 --> 00:00:10.919
We have to declare the events before they are emptied.

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:13.230
The front-end offer tab can watch for

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.350
these events and carry on specific actions accordingly.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.945
So, we have two events that we're defining here.

00:00:18.945 --> 00:00:20.910
The first is called the ForSale event,

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.800
and the second is called the Sold event.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.170
Both of them are accepting one parameter each.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.785
So, the first one is accepting a parameter or an argument

00:00:28.785 --> 00:00:32.810
called skuCount and the second one is also accepting this sku.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.730
Now, we can emit these events inside of functions.

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:38.640
We will look at this later then we'll write out the functions.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.780
In the next video, we will write out all the modifiers that a smart contract needs.
