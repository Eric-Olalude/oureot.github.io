00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.305
Before we get started with the details of the Blockchain,

00:00:03.305 --> 00:00:06.050
it's helpful to understand why it even exists.

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:08.699
The Blockchain was originally made to try and solve

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:12.104
problems that were seen with the way we make financial transactions.

00:00:12.105 --> 00:00:14.820
In this video, we'll talk about some of the core ideas

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.250
behind how financial transactions work without the Blockchain.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.010
This will help us better understand

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.365
the solution that the Blockchain team tries to provide.

00:00:22.364 --> 00:00:25.649
Later, we can abstract these ideas beyond finance to

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:29.969
understand how it can provide the same types of solutions across other industries.

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:34.420
So to start, here's some of the questions the Blockchain tries to answer.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.475
What makes money valuable?

00:00:36.475 --> 00:00:38.170
Why do people use it?

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.935
Is there a way we can improve the current system?

00:00:40.935 --> 00:00:44.690
To answer this, let's break down how the current system works.

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:47.729
Pretend we don't have a way to make transactions at all,

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:51.864
our goal is to help set up a system to help people make transactions.

00:00:51.865 --> 00:00:55.850
To start, we know that everyone has some type of product or service,

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.950
there are people who need these products and services and there are

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.255
other people who are willing to give something in return for them.

00:01:02.255 --> 00:01:07.305
The problem is, there's no way for anyone to make transactions with each other.

00:01:07.305 --> 00:01:09.325
So how can we solve this?

00:01:09.325 --> 00:01:12.055
The first thing you can do is start trading.

00:01:12.055 --> 00:01:15.000
You'll have to decide how much value you place in something,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.430
and what you're willing to get in return for it.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.960
Once you do that, you're able to start trading your product with others.

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:22.559
This is a great start,

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.670
but it gets tough because no one really agrees on the exact value for anything.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.445
Every trade needs to be negotiated.

00:01:29.444 --> 00:01:34.199
What we could really use is something that we all agree has a certain intrinsic value,

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.855
something like gold becomes useful there.

00:01:36.855 --> 00:01:40.030
If we can agree on how much a certain amount of gold is worth,

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.390
we can assign each of our products are value based on that,

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.920
and to take it one step further,

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.590
we can make a currency to trade in place of that gold.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.150
So now we have money.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.780
If I want a new game to play,

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.200
I don't need to go to the store with things to trade them,

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.234
I just give them the money it's worth.

00:01:55.234 --> 00:01:56.689
Now that we have money,

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.799
we'll need someone to track and manage the transactions we're making.

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:01.629
That's where banks come in.

00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:06.039
The solutions they provide are exactly what the Blockchain is trying to improve.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.085
Keep that in mind as we go through this next section.

00:02:09.085 --> 00:02:13.344
Banks keep track of our transactions to keep our money safe and secure.

00:02:13.344 --> 00:02:16.129
They're what's known as a trusted third party.

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.729
That term comes up a lot in Blockchain.

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:24.074
A trusted third party is an entity that facilitates interactions between two parties.

00:02:24.074 --> 00:02:27.280
They help establish the security we need to store our money,

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.094
and trust our transactions.

00:02:29.094 --> 00:02:31.150
This is extremely valuable,

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.719
and what's really interesting is how they can do it.

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:36.219
There are a ton of systems in place that make this happen,

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:39.520
but one important tool they use is what's known as a ledger.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.780
A ledger is a record of transaction information.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.335
It includes information about who sent money,

00:02:45.335 --> 00:02:47.135
who received it, when it happened,

00:02:47.134 --> 00:02:48.979
and how much was sent.

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:53.524
Having a record of all these transactions helps the bank do some pretty cool stuff.

00:02:53.525 --> 00:02:56.275
For one, they always know who has money,

00:02:56.275 --> 00:02:59.110
who owes money, and how much money exists.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.095
They can use this information to ensure trust between people

00:03:02.094 --> 00:03:05.305
who are making transactions that might not even know each other.

00:03:05.305 --> 00:03:09.245
This helps them solve what's known as the double-spending problem.

00:03:09.245 --> 00:03:14.439
Double-spending is the term for when someone spends the same money more than once,

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:16.300
for a financial system to work,

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.335
this can't be possible because that person would basically be duplicating money.

00:03:20.335 --> 00:03:24.710
Banks can prevent double-spending because of the records they keep on their ledger.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.409
They know what was sent, and when it happened.

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:29.419
If someone tries to spend money twice,

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:32.289
the transaction that happened first will go through,

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:34.120
and by the time the second one happens,

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.640
the money will be gone already.

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:40.329
The bank knows what time the first transaction happens so they can invalidate later ones.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.240
This helps them settle any disputes,

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.719
confusion or theft that might happen.

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:46.520
Since they have all the information,

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.235
they can decide who is what?

00:03:48.235 --> 00:03:51.460
So that's one way to go about solving this problem,

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.835
and it's what we've done for a very long time.

00:03:53.835 --> 00:03:56.200
But the Blockchain thinks there could be a different,

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:57.530
better way to do this.

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.460
Before we jump into how they do it,

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.969
try to think about it for yourself.

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:04.724
Is there anything you think could be improved if the system were different?

00:04:04.724 --> 00:04:06.569
What would that system look like?

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:11.125
As a start, focused on how banks use a ledger to help solve the double-spending problem.

00:04:11.125 --> 00:04:14.009
Is there a way we might not need banks to do this for us?

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:15.969
If you're not sure, don't worry about it.

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:17.269
This is a tough problem.

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.599
We're just hoping you get a chance to think a little differently about all this.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.320
We'll spend the rest of this program talking about

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:26.365
the answers the Blockchain has to these types of questions.

00:04:26.365 --> 00:04:27.850
See what you come up with,

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.910
and when you're ready, we'll see you in the next video.
