00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
A consensus algorithm is fundamental to

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.005
ensuring a Blockchain remains a trustworthy version of truth.

00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:10.240
It also prevents any potential adversaries from breaking the system.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.290
While this method of achieving consensus has been successful so far,

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.990
it does have some issues.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.155
There are two commonly discussed issues with proof-of-work.

00:00:19.155 --> 00:00:22.770
High energy consumption and the minor monopoly problem.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.255
First, proof of work leads to an extremely high amount of energy consumption.

00:00:27.255 --> 00:00:30.960
Proof-of-work calculations require a lot of computing power,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.375
all this computing comes at a cost both financially and to the environment.

00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:38.640
To mine Bitcoin, miners setup mining rigs

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.395
which are high powered computers that process new blocks.

00:00:42.395 --> 00:00:47.345
Rig can be a dedicated computer design and built specifically for mining,

00:00:47.345 --> 00:00:52.170
it could also be a computer that was built for something else like a gaming system,

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.700
but which has enough memory and

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.725
processing power to perform the calculations needed for mining.

00:00:57.725 --> 00:01:00.325
People can set up mining rigs in their homes,

00:01:00.325 --> 00:01:04.225
but there are also mining farms run by larger operations housing hundreds

00:01:04.225 --> 00:01:08.475
and even sometimes thousands of rigs dedicated to Bitcoin mining.

00:01:08.475 --> 00:01:12.340
In 2017, one of the world's largest Bitcoin mines,

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.285
was located in Inner Mongolia,

00:01:14.285 --> 00:01:19.660
and it has 25 thousand machines working 24 hours a day to mine Bitcoin.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.770
All these mining rigs around the world demand a lot of processing power.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.500
Some reports claim that Bitcoin mining,

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.950
is consuming more electricity than 159 countries

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.215
around the world including Ireland and most countries in Afrika.

00:01:34.215 --> 00:01:36.135
At the end of 2017,

00:01:36.135 --> 00:01:38.095
Global Bitcoin mining consumption,

00:01:38.095 --> 00:01:41.900
used as much energy as two million US homes combined.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.385
And it's actually possible to use a Bitcoin mining rig to heat your home.

00:01:46.385 --> 00:01:49.965
The second problem is the minor monopoly problem.

00:01:49.965 --> 00:01:54.085
Because Bitcoin mining requires a lot of computing power and energy,

00:01:54.085 --> 00:01:58.895
those who have the resources to access more equipment have an unfair advantage.

00:01:58.895 --> 00:02:04.045
The diagram here shows the distribution of the largest mining pools around the world.

00:02:04.045 --> 00:02:06.865
As you can see, it's a little bit skewed.

00:02:06.865 --> 00:02:10.800
The mining farms we mentioned earlier actually contribute to this problem,

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.640
they've helped lead to a monopoly of

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.775
Bitcoin miners that control a majority of the network.

00:02:15.775 --> 00:02:19.540
Since these nodes dedicate more resources to the network,

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.450
they have more say in which blocks are considered valid.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.770
This causes the network to lean towards becoming centralized,

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.455
rather than staying distributed like it was originally intended.

00:02:29.455 --> 00:02:33.055
So that wraps up the issues with the proof of work algorithm.

00:02:33.055 --> 00:02:35.550
Given these challenges with proof-of-work,

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.945
other consensus algorithms have been developed to try and fix some of these issues.

00:02:39.945 --> 00:02:44.290
Coming up, we'll explore some of these algorithms in more detail.
