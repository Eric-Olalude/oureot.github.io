00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.825
Each of the Bitcoin Core networks, so the mainnet,

00:00:03.825 --> 00:00:08.400
the testnet, and the regnet can be accessed using the Bitcoin Core client.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.269
Switching between each of these environments will allow you to access the features of

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.050
each network and more easily setup development environments for your Bitcoin application.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.050
Even if you don't plan on switching back and forth between networks,

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.449
you can use this method I'm going to show you to

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:25.804
change the default network of the Bitcoin application.

00:00:25.804 --> 00:00:29.620
This may be helpful in the case that you don't want to stick to the mainnet

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.789
and would prefer to only ever use the testnet or the regnet.

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:37.179
Now, in this video, we'll quickly overview how to

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:41.030
switch between each of these networks using the Bitcoin Core client.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.920
To start, let's go into the main network.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.670
So, if you actually don't want to go into the main network,

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.035
wait for a moment until I start talking about the testnet and then follow along.

00:00:51.034 --> 00:00:52.689
Now to go to the main network,

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:56.539
navigate to your Bitcoin core application and open it up.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.840
If you're opening this application for the first time,

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.720
or haven't opened it in a while,

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.709
you'll notice the client might take some time to sink to the blockchain.

00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:10.564
The default network is the mainnet.

00:01:10.564 --> 00:01:12.439
So, once this application opens,

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.424
you'll be on the main network.

00:01:14.424 --> 00:01:16.875
Next, we'll switch to the test network.

00:01:16.875 --> 00:01:20.810
Now there are two ways to kick off the testnet with the Bitcoin Core client.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.465
The first option is to run the client with a flag used to set the testnet.

00:01:25.465 --> 00:01:28.055
The second option, which is preferred,

00:01:28.055 --> 00:01:31.680
is to use a Bitcoin configuration file.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.675
To use the Bitcoin configuration file,

00:01:34.674 --> 00:01:38.840
you need to create this file inside your Bitcoin core directory.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.730
Once created, you can use this file to

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.520
help provide directions to the Bitcoin Core application.

00:01:44.519 --> 00:01:47.924
This file will have a few purposes as we move forward.

00:01:47.924 --> 00:01:52.534
But for now, it helps us get set up specifically to help change networks.

00:01:52.534 --> 00:01:58.649
To make this file, open up a text editor such as Visual Studio or Sublime,

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.725
but any simple text editor will do.

00:02:01.724 --> 00:02:05.809
In this file, type testnet=1.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.979
This tells the Bitcoin Core client to load

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.905
the application into the test network rather than into the main network.

00:02:12.905 --> 00:02:16.379
Name this file Bitcoin core.conf so

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:21.139
C-O-N-F and save this file inside your Bitcoin core directory.

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:22.859
All right. That's all we have to do.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.340
So this file is read automatically when you start up Bitcoin core.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.055
Since it's read while starting the program,

00:02:30.055 --> 00:02:32.590
we'll need to quit our application and restart it.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.229
So, go ahead and restart your application,

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:38.189
or if you haven't opened it just yet you can do that now.

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:40.719
What you'll notice is that while starting up,

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:43.884
the logo changes to green and then in top right,

00:02:43.884 --> 00:02:46.189
you'll see that it's marked as testnet.

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:48.609
So, these are indicators that you can use to

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.310
see that you've correctly accessed the testnet.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.580
Once logged in, you should see that everything looks pretty much the same as before.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.460
You have access to a wallet overview and can send and receive transactions.

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.070
The difference now is that these coins have

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.810
no value and you can play around in it as a test environment.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.314
We'll spend a lot of time in this network as we continue development.

00:03:10.314 --> 00:03:12.289
But before getting into details,

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:15.409
I'd like to show you how to access the Regnet.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.995
To do this, it's really similar to what we just did before and rather quick.

00:03:20.995 --> 00:03:25.390
So, go back to your Bitcoin core.conf file and

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:30.034
remove or comment out with a hashtag where you wrote testnet equals one.

00:03:30.034 --> 00:03:33.014
Instead of this, right regnet=1.

00:03:33.014 --> 00:03:39.169
Now, save that off and restart the application again and it will load into the regnet.

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:44.284
Again, it's pretty simple but definitely not intuitive if you haven't seen it before.

00:03:44.284 --> 00:03:46.560
Finally, to get back to the main net,

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.685
you just remove all this information from the Bitcoin Core.conf file.

00:03:51.685 --> 00:03:54.555
You can do this by deleting the texts,

00:03:54.555 --> 00:03:57.870
commenting it out, or deleting the file completely.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.490
For now, I recommend commenting it out.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.525
It makes it quicker to jump between these networks in the future.

00:04:03.525 --> 00:04:05.955
This configuration file will continue to

00:04:05.955 --> 00:04:08.585
grow over time as we learn more about its functionality.

00:04:08.585 --> 00:04:13.050
Finally, you don't need to actually create this Bitcoin.conf file yourself,

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.650
you can do it directly from the wallet interface.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.730
To do this, from the wallet,

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.085
navigate to Bitcoin core.

00:04:20.084 --> 00:04:24.029
Select "Preferences" and then

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:28.934
choose "Open configuration file" from the bottom left of the pop-up window.

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:32.235
We avoided doing this at first because you will need to first

00:04:32.235 --> 00:04:35.335
log into the main net wallet to get access to this feature.

00:04:35.334 --> 00:04:39.134
This will start sinking the main net blockchain and take up a lot of space

00:04:39.134 --> 00:04:43.305
you may have been trying to avoid by creating this file. All right. So that's a wrap.

00:04:43.305 --> 00:04:47.340
That's how you access each of the networks available for the Bitcoin Core client.

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:52.464
When you're done, you can close out the console or stay on and experiment.

00:04:52.464 --> 00:04:54.929
We'll continue to learn more about each of

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.329
these networks as we use them throughout the program.
