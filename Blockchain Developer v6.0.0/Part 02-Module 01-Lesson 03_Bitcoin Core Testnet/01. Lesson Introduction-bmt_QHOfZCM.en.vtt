00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.044
Welcome to the lesson on Bitcoin Core.

00:00:03.044 --> 00:00:05.429
Bitcoin Core is a powerful set of

00:00:05.429 --> 00:00:09.214
developer tools to help you create applications on the Bitcoin blockchain.

00:00:09.214 --> 00:00:11.669
The goal of this lesson is to get you up and running

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:14.265
with your own Bitcoin Core development environment.

00:00:14.265 --> 00:00:17.155
Throughout this lesson, we'll introduce Bitcoin Core,

00:00:17.155 --> 00:00:19.350
its purpose, and the tools it makes available

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.875
to you to help build and deploy applications.

00:00:21.875 --> 00:00:24.870
Once set up, you'll start to create transactions between

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.170
wallets using a Bitcoin Core test environment.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.330
You will investigate the transactions made using

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:31.949
the online Block Explorer to get

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.685
better idea of how transactions flow through the network.

00:00:34.685 --> 00:00:37.650
All this, will prepare you to complete your next project,

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.204
where you'll start to make transactions using your own private blockchain.

00:00:41.204 --> 00:00:43.329

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.360
and when you're ready, we'll see you in the lesson.
