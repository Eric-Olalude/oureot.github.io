00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.069
An important part of

00:00:02.069 --> 00:00:06.554
the Bitcoin core ecosystem is the different networks that are provided for you.

00:00:06.554 --> 00:00:11.599
These environments are for developers to test and deploy Bitcoin applications.

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:13.330
To do this effectively,

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.515
they provide three different networks each serving a different purpose.

00:00:17.515 --> 00:00:19.755
These networks are the Mainnet,

00:00:19.754 --> 00:00:22.259
the Testnet, and the Regnet.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.480
In this video we'll explore the purpose of each of

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.410
these networks to help you understand when it's best to use them.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.804
The Bitcoin Mainnet is the one you may already be familiar with just not by the name.

00:00:34.804 --> 00:00:38.394
It's a primary network where live transactions take place.

00:00:38.395 --> 00:00:41.080
Everything you have heard about sending Bitcoins and

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:44.384
using wallets is all taking place on this network.

00:00:44.384 --> 00:00:46.554
The coins used here have

00:00:46.554 --> 00:00:50.984
real-world value and is what you've been accessing using your Bitcoin wallet.

00:00:50.984 --> 00:00:54.704
The purpose of this mainnet is to handle live transactions with

00:00:54.704 --> 00:00:58.589
coins that have real-world value across your network appears.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.030
This is great for providing all the functionality of Bitcoin,

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.914
but it makes it difficult to test

00:01:03.914 --> 00:01:06.625
new applications on it without slowing down the network.

00:01:06.625 --> 00:01:12.700
To handle this, Bitcoin core has a test environment meant for testing applications.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.469
The Bitcoin Testnet is an alternative Bitcoin blockchain

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:19.650
to provide a test environment for Bitcoin applications.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.215
In the Testnet you have access to Testnet coins.

00:01:24.215 --> 00:01:28.180
These coins have no real-world value and allow you to

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.740
test the functionality of your application without needing to spend real Bitcoins.

00:01:32.739 --> 00:01:35.229
The goal is to allow you to develop

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.810
a personal sendbox environment without having to

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.820
spend real bitcoins and breaking the Mainnet.

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:43.149
This allows you to interact with peers on

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.385
the network that is entirely separate from the Mainnet.

00:01:46.385 --> 00:01:50.770
One key function to note is that it still operates as a network.

00:01:50.769 --> 00:01:53.950
Things like creating new blocks and validating

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.284
transactions still have to be done using the network.

00:01:57.284 --> 00:01:59.799
This can slow down testing time if you wait for

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.079
a block or transactions to complete their life cycle.

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:06.679
To help address some of these concerns and speed up testing,

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.790
the Regnet was created.

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.014
The Regnet, short for

00:02:11.014 --> 00:02:16.379
regression test mode is an alternative network for testing Bitcoin applications.

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.590
Like the Testnet, you'll use this network for

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.700
testing applications using coins that have no real-world value.

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:26.399
The difference is that on the Regnet,

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.819
you no longer have a network appears to work with.

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.370
You can instantaneously create new blocks and have complete control over

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.009
the environment that you're testing in and this will

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:39.199
significantly speed up test development time.

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:40.659
Each of these networks has

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:45.270
their own specific use cases and gives you the opportunity to create,

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.260
test, and deploy new Bitcoin applications as efficiently as possible.

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:53.289
Coming up, we'll compare each of these networks and

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:57.159
a little more detail then get you up and running with them.
