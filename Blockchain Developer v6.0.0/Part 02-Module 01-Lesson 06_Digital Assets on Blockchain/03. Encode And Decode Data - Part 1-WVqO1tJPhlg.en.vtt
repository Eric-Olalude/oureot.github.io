00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.990
Now that we know what a digital asset is and how it's related to the blockchain,

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.595
it's important to step back and consider some important questions.

00:00:08.595 --> 00:00:10.894
How do digital assets work?

00:00:10.894 --> 00:00:14.359
To get the answer, we can look at a more specific question.

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:19.019
That question is how do computers understand the contents of a file,

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.375
and how do they present those files to people?

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:24.509
Once we understand how this communication happens,

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.984
we'll be ready to start incorporating these ideas into our blockchain applications.

00:00:28.984 --> 00:00:31.980
Here, we'll specifically focus on one answer to

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.115
this question and it has to do with encoding and decoding.

00:00:36.115 --> 00:00:40.920
Encoding and decoding is the process of producing and interpreting information.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.250
It's used across many fields of study.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.579
But in computer science,

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.329
its main focus is facilitating the sending and receiving of data.

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.429
It's the process of translating a message between human-readable data and raw data.

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:56.570
We encode information into raw data to allow

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.075
computers to send information in a format they understand.

00:01:00.075 --> 00:01:02.600
Later, this information is decoded

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.420
into a format that people can understand and work with.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.405
Next, let's look a little more specifically at encoding.

00:01:09.405 --> 00:01:13.295
Encoding is the process of putting a sequence of characters like

00:01:13.295 --> 00:01:17.945
text into a specialized format for efficient transmission or storage.

00:01:17.944 --> 00:01:21.424
What's special about this is what it allows you to do.

00:01:21.424 --> 00:01:23.689
Basically, the goal of encoding is to

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.534
help us send and receive messages between each other.

00:01:26.534 --> 00:01:29.575
For example, when speaking to another person,

00:01:29.575 --> 00:01:31.320
if you both know the same language,

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:34.164
you can just speak freely and understand each other.

00:01:34.165 --> 00:01:36.960
Now, if instead of talking in person,

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:38.890
you put that message into a computer,

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.174
you're not just talking to that person anymore.

00:01:41.174 --> 00:01:43.875
You're including computers in the conversation.

00:01:43.875 --> 00:01:48.260
For that reason, they need to understand what you're talking about to send messages.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.704
This is done using encoding.

00:01:50.704 --> 00:01:52.989
There's a couple ways to encode data,

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:55.284
some of which you may have already heard before,

00:01:55.284 --> 00:01:58.969
things like hexadecimal, Base64 and ASCII.

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:01.704
We'll cover each of these in more detail soon.

00:02:01.704 --> 00:02:04.129
The point to keep in mind for now is that each of

00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:08.129
these encoding schemes can take in information to encode it as raw data.

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.990
This raw data is what is then transmitted between computers.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.290
One thing to note here is that you might remember the algorithms

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:18.495
used to generate private keys like SHA-256.

00:02:18.495 --> 00:02:20.835
These algorithms are used for encryption,

00:02:20.835 --> 00:02:22.655
which is different than encoding.

00:02:22.655 --> 00:02:25.810
With encryption, you're trying to make a secret key in

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.569
a way that can't be reversed and only you have access to.

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.834
With encoding, you're simply trying to reformat something to make it easier to transmit.

00:02:34.835 --> 00:02:39.645
Another thing to note is that encoding isn't really the same as compression either.

00:02:39.645 --> 00:02:42.965
The goal of compression is to make file smaller.

00:02:42.965 --> 00:02:46.300
With encoding, you actually can end up with a larger file,

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.260
but the important thing is that the speed at

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:50.924
which it can be read and transmitted is improved.

00:02:50.925 --> 00:02:53.495
The steps on how to encode data are different

00:02:53.495 --> 00:02:56.159
depending on how you would like to encode it.

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:59.460
We'll be encoding images using these ideas later in the lesson,

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.465
but first, let's look a little closer at decoding.

00:03:02.465 --> 00:03:06.629
While encoding prepares files for efficient transmission or storage,

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:09.044
decoding does the exact opposite.

00:03:09.044 --> 00:03:12.149
Decoding allows you to take encoded, raw,

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.425
unreadable files, and convert them back into a human-readable format.

00:03:16.425 --> 00:03:19.070
You'll decode something anytime you want to present

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.814
information to someone in a way that they can understand and work with.

00:03:22.814 --> 00:03:26.544
Using the same schemes like hexadecimal, Base64,

00:03:26.544 --> 00:03:31.769
and ASCII, you can convert the raw data files back into the file type they started as.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.974
The process of encoding and decoding is happening constantly.

00:03:35.973 --> 00:03:38.299
When you upload a file to a website,

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.265
you've encoded data that will be decoded when someone needs to use it.

00:03:42.264 --> 00:03:46.284
If you've ever used a service like Skype or Google Hangouts,

00:03:46.284 --> 00:03:49.299
you're receiving a live stream of data that was encoded,

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.990
transferred over the Internet,

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.265
and decoded to present to you.

00:03:53.264 --> 00:03:55.669
The end result is that the computers and

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:58.609
networks get to communicate in a format they use,

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.510
and you get to communicate using live video or whatever media you happen to be using.

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:07.629
So, that wraps up our basic overview of encoding versus decoding.

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:12.269
The idea here was just to clarify what these terms mean and their purpose.

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.639
Coming up, we'll look more specifically at certain types of encoding.
