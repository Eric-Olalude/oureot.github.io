00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.359
We just covered that private keys generate the public keys

00:00:03.359 --> 00:00:07.035
and wallet addresses that allow us to interact with the blockchain.

00:00:07.035 --> 00:00:09.250
For a private key to be secure,

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.469
we need to use a cryptographically secure random number generator

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.344
that ensures a private key we create cannot be easily traced.

00:00:17.344 --> 00:00:22.109
And in this section, I'll show you how to use a Bitcoin address generating website,

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.599
that uses your operating systems underlying

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.714
random number generator to produce a 256-bit Random Number.

00:00:29.714 --> 00:00:33.804
One popular website is bitaddress.org.

00:00:33.804 --> 00:00:39.155
This isn't open source JavaScript client-side Bitcoin wallet generator,

00:00:39.155 --> 00:00:41.465
it's an online service that helps you generate

00:00:41.465 --> 00:00:45.035
a random Bitcoin address and associated private key.

00:00:45.034 --> 00:00:48.169
To be secure when generating a private key,

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.135
I suggest that you do this offline.

00:00:50.134 --> 00:00:55.849
This way, all the activity you do is local to your computer and cannot be traced online.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.225
So to do this, in the browser,

00:00:58.225 --> 00:01:01.460
first choose "Save page as",

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.430
and save the file to your computer.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.469
Next, disconnect from the Internet.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.990
Now, open the bitaddress.org.html file that you saved.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.935
This is when bitaddress will generate a random set of keys.

00:01:29.935 --> 00:01:34.004
To do this, it all requests your help to really spice things up,

00:01:34.004 --> 00:01:36.079
and add a little entropy.

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.689
You'll move your mouse around the screen and bitaddress will

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.189
sample the mouse coordinates to contribute to the number generation.

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:48.109
Alternatively, you could type some random characters into this textbox here,

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:51.099
and we'll use those values instead.

00:01:53.019 --> 00:01:56.239
Once your wallet has achieved full randomness,

00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:58.839
it will spit out a Bitcoin address and

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.130
a private key as well as their related QR codes that you can share with others.

00:02:03.129 --> 00:02:06.144
Now if none of the methods I've shown you strike your fancy,

00:02:06.144 --> 00:02:11.150
remember that software wallets such as electron will generate private keys for you.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.860
Let's jump back into electron,

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.750
and see where we can find private keys that it generated for us.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.199
From the addresses tab,

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:26.204
we can see a list of Wallet addresses.

00:02:26.205 --> 00:02:28.625
To see the associated private key,

00:02:28.625 --> 00:02:32.870
right-click on the address and navigate to reveal your private key.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.504
Now remember, be very careful and do not share this information.

00:02:41.504 --> 00:02:45.669
The wallet I created here is only for learning purposes.

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:49.724
What if you'd like to view multiple private keys at the same time?

00:02:49.724 --> 00:02:51.968
Another method to view addresses,

00:02:51.968 --> 00:02:53.250
from the view here,

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.840
is from wallet, navigate to private keys, and they go to export.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.164
Here, you have the option to export a list of

00:03:04.164 --> 00:03:07.729
all your wallet addresses and their associated private keys,

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:10.849
in either CSV or JSON format.

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:12.789
You may be wondering, well,

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:15.484
if the private key is supposed to be so private,

00:03:15.485 --> 00:03:17.785
why are there options to reveal it?

00:03:17.784 --> 00:03:22.109
So it's possible that you may need to restore your wallet for a number of reasons.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.750
This is a time that you might need to access your private keys,

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.615
but be very cautious when handling this information.

00:03:28.615 --> 00:03:31.995
Now that it wraps it up for the private key section.

00:03:31.995 --> 00:03:36.224
To recap, we learned that wallets store private keys.

00:03:36.224 --> 00:03:39.579
These private keys in turn generate public keys and

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.210
wallet addresses that allow us to interact with the blockchain.

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.730
Private keys are nothing more than

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:50.384
a random number that's between one and two to the power of 256,

00:03:50.384 --> 00:03:51.864
a number that's so big,

00:03:51.865 --> 00:03:55.725
it's near impossible for the same two private keys to exist.

00:03:55.724 --> 00:04:00.655
Lastly, we saw three different ways to generate a private key.

00:04:00.655 --> 00:04:03.735
There's the old flipping of coin method,

00:04:03.735 --> 00:04:06.370
we could use a random number generator,

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.759
that's provided by industry bedded library,

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:12.724
or we could use a Bitcoin address generating website.

00:04:12.724 --> 00:04:17.129
Give the following quiz a try and generate a private key on your own.
