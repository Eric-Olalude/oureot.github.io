Hi. My name is Balaji Srinivasan.

00:00:02.365 --> 00:00:03.940
I'm the CTO of Coinbase.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.224
Okay, so, why is identity important in blockchain?

00:00:06.224 --> 00:00:07.830
So, on the one hand,

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.879
you think of cryptocurrencies being this pseudonymous or anonymous thing,

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.515
so where does identity comes in?

00:00:12.515 --> 00:00:14.900
Well, when you use your credit card,

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.835
the reason that your name is on the credit card is

00:00:16.835 --> 00:00:20.210
your debiting from your account rather than somebody else's when you swipe it.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.880
So, there has to be some kind of identity match in

00:00:22.879 --> 00:00:26.434
electronic database and there's a minus to your account and a plus to theirs.

00:00:26.434 --> 00:00:31.034
In the same way, when you move cryptocurrency from one address to another,

00:00:31.035 --> 00:00:33.140
you are effectively presenting

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.480
a digital signature that shows that you control that address, right?

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:40.609
You're signing a transaction and that shows you have control over

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:42.289
the amount of cryptocurrency that's

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:44.179
at this address that you can move it to somewhere else.

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:46.780
That signature is itself fact of an identity mechanism.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.240
That's why identities [inaudible].
