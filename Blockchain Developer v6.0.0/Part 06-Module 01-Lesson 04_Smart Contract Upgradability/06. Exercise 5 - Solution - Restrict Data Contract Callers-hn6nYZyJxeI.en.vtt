00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.785
Okay. Let's implement the tasks for this exercise in our code.

00:00:07.785 --> 00:00:11.220
So what we're going to do now is modify

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:17.714
our data contract and prevent unauthorized contracts from calling into it.

00:00:17.714 --> 00:00:25.725
So the first thing we want to do is add a mapping that will be for addresses.

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:30.000
Now in this case, I've recommended uint256,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.509
but really there's many different ways in which you could do this.

00:00:33.509 --> 00:00:35.384
You could have a Boolean.

00:00:35.384 --> 00:00:40.519
The idea here was to provide a really simple way in which we

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.265
can restrict contracts and you might come up with better and more robust ways.

00:00:46.265 --> 00:00:52.685
This is not intended to be the definitive way in which you would do this. All right.

00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:55.850
So the next thing we're going to do is add some functions here

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.719
for authorizing the contract.

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:11.239
That'll be external and we do want to constrain it.

00:01:11.239 --> 00:01:13.890
So we'll say requireContractOwner,

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:27.555
and what we'll do here is add the data contract address to our collection,

00:01:27.555 --> 00:01:31.330
which is named authorizedContracts.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.335
All right. With that done,

00:01:40.334 --> 00:01:48.359
so that's our function to authorize and we can modify that slightly to deauthorize.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.609
We want to make sure the deauthorize is actually a fairly important component of

00:01:55.609 --> 00:02:02.030
this because once you have upgraded your application contract,

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.430
which is the whole point of the architecture we've discussed here,

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.060
you want to delete a reference to the prior version and

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.930
prevent it from calling into your contract anymore.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.504
So we've got our two functions,

00:02:16.504 --> 00:02:19.799
and the other thing we want is a function modifier,

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.620
for expediency we'll just copy this and modify it,

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.349
and say is color authorized,

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.939
and the code is going to be

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:47.159
authorizedContracts message.sender equals 1.

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:49.509
It's going to require that.

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:56.849
All right.

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:03.379
So on any function that is expected to have an outside caller,

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:08.599
you'd want to put this as a required modifier.

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.629
So I'll save that and make sure it still

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:21.750
compiles, and it does.
