00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
All right. Let's set the address for

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:11.205
the data contract in the constructor for the app smart contract.

00:00:11.205 --> 00:00:17.500
So we're going to add a parameter called address dataContract.

00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:28.719
We are going to tell the variable we have how exactly to find that contract.

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.929
So in the previous exercise the work we did was really lay the groundwork

00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:40.189
for how this contract should interact with the data contract,

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:43.789
but it's these two lines of code that we just added that are really the most

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:49.640
relevant because it tells the app how to go find the data.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.975
Notice that we did not do any such thing with the data contract.

00:00:53.975 --> 00:00:59.030
The reason for that is because if you recollect from the earlier slide,

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.905
the arrow is unidirectional.

00:01:00.905 --> 00:01:07.370
The app contract is always calling in to the data contract and never the other way.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.069
There's one more step to this exercise,

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:16.609
and that is to go and change this function modifier.

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:19.405
So notice up here that update employee.

00:01:19.405 --> 00:01:23.135
This is the actual function that is going to be called from the app contract,

00:01:23.135 --> 00:01:24.880
but it has a constraint.

00:01:24.879 --> 00:01:33.310
It requires that the caller be the contract owner whoever has deployed the data contract.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.150
That will not work anymore so we have to remove that.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.410
Let's save and compile.

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:46.935
All right, and that passed.

00:01:46.935 --> 00:01:48.965
So just to reiterate,

00:01:48.965 --> 00:01:54.670
the constructor off the application smart contract is

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.740
passed the address of the deployed instance off the data contract,

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:08.104
and that is used to create and hydrate the instance variable for that contract.

00:02:08.104 --> 00:02:11.119
So if you don't do this then

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.965
the app contract has no way of knowing where to find the data contract.

00:02:15.965 --> 00:02:18.659
Let's take a quiz.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.539
When referencing contract A from contract B,

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:30.900
what address is required to instantiate contract A and contract B's code?
