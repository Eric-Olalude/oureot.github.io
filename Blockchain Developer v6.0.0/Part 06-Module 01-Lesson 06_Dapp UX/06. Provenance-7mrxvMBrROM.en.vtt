00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.404
The next topic in user experience is Provenance.

00:00:03.404 --> 00:00:07.964
Now provenance is a really huge topic when it comes to blockchain because it's

00:00:07.964 --> 00:00:12.719
used a lot in supply chain to figure out where things are made et cetera.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:19.635
But provenance also applies in your relationship as a DAP developer and the user.

00:00:19.635 --> 00:00:23.040
One of the things that the user does not know when dealing with

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.785
a blockchain app is where the data is going and where its coming from.

00:00:28.785 --> 00:00:30.420
In a typical app,

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.329
maybe it's a web app or a mobile app,

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.479
it's pretty clear to them when they are posting something that is going to be public.

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:41.899
It's also pretty clear to them that

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:47.435
the owning entity of the application controls that data.

00:00:47.435 --> 00:00:48.650
So if you're on Facebook,

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:49.820
you make a post, you have that.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.579
If you are a Google search,

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.949
you know that that's being logged et cetera.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.435
But on the blockchain,

00:00:56.435 --> 00:00:58.370
it's much more complicated.

00:00:58.369 --> 00:01:01.579
One of the things that most users are not aware of,

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:03.515
that all user data;

00:01:03.515 --> 00:01:06.215
everything on the blockchain is public.

00:01:06.215 --> 00:01:15.420
So they might inadvertently submit something that is going to end up being publicized.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.379
The other thing is they don't know where

00:01:18.379 --> 00:01:21.729
the data that they are looking at is coming from.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:27.680
So what you need to do is to make sure that as the user is using your DAP,

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.805
it's clear to them what data is coming from the blockchain and is public,

00:01:31.805 --> 00:01:37.295
what data is coming from a database and is potentially private or semi-private.

00:01:37.295 --> 00:01:39.805
Finally, and this is very important,

00:01:39.805 --> 00:01:45.320
what data is coming from a third party Oracle that you have no control over.

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:51.469
That's a high-risk area because as we learned in the prior lessons,

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:54.230
you can have oracles that abuse

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:59.689
their privilege and might try to gain the system and provide misinformation.

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:07.789
So if you have a DAP view where you are combining information from the blockchain,

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.370
from a third party source such as an Oracle,

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.819
and perhaps also from a corporate database et cetera,

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.569
it behooves you to make sure that the user clearly

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.340
understands that perhaps you have labels or you have colors,

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.150
things like that to clearly delineate that data so there's

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.360
no confusion on the part of the user about where things are coming from.
