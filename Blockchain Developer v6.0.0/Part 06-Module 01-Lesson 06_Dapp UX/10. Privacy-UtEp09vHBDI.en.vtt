00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.685
Our next item is privacy.

00:00:02.685 --> 00:00:04.665
This is super important.

00:00:04.665 --> 00:00:08.775
We are now in a time

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:14.160
where there's a lot of privacy related issues that users are dealing with.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.699
So they're getting increasingly aware and increasingly conscious about it.

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.024
There's legislation already in place and more emerging to protect user privacy.

00:00:23.024 --> 00:00:27.449
As a Dapp developer, it's going to be your responsibility to ensure

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.269
that you don't unwittingly make sensitive information available in the public.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.190
So always be aware especially when you're working with public blockchains,

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:42.409
that there is no such thing as privacy on the public blockchain.

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:45.004
So you might perhaps think that you have

00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:48.950
a private variable and you could store information in that.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.790
Well, as we have discussed in the prior lesson,

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:55.640
that private variable is still on the blockchain and

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.314
visible in public to whoever has the wherewithal to look at it.

00:00:59.314 --> 00:01:03.589
So when you have a scenario where there is

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.635
private user information that needs to be

00:01:06.635 --> 00:01:10.300
in your smart contract to interact with your smart contract,

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.179
it's very important that you think carefully and answer the question,

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.865
does this need to be here?

00:01:15.864 --> 00:01:20.780
If it truly does need to be there it is probably a good idea to make sure that you

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.655
never actually store the information directly in your smart contract.

00:01:25.655 --> 00:01:29.930
You should either hash it and use that if it's possible to do

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.400
that or you should indirectly secure the information,

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.275
perhaps encrypt it and use IPFS with IPFS hash in storage.

00:01:40.275 --> 00:01:42.700
That way there are two levels of interaction,

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.010
there is the hash that someone has to locate with

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.460
the IPFS file and then once they have the file,

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:51.479
they have to decrypt the file.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.710
So be very aware,

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:56.119
be hyper-aware in fact of

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.885
user privacy when it comes to public blockchain scenarios because it is very

00:01:59.885 --> 00:02:08.490
easy to get private information placed forever in public since it's immutable.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.620
All right. With that out of the way,

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.780
let's take another quiz.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.730
How can you raise a user's awareness about their context within a Dapp.
