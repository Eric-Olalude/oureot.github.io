00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.830
Before we can begin building Internet solution,

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.435
it's important to understand the context in which you'll be building them.

00:00:06.434 --> 00:00:10.500
So, in our case, we'll need to understand the blockchain architecture.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.279
So, blockchain solutions interface with the world wide web.

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:18.585
Not only that, but they're actually changing the very nature of the web itself.

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:24.000
In this section, we'll discuss Web 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.984
Meaning the past, present, and future of the internet.

00:00:26.984 --> 00:00:28.980
So with that, let's get started.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.789
Now, the birth of the internet can be deemed as Web 1.0.

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:38.354
It allows users a one-way system to request data in a read-only format from the server.

00:00:38.354 --> 00:00:41.089
In this world, users passively consulted

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.380
Web pages and for the most part didn't really participate in generating any content.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.600
Then came Web 2.0,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.984
which allowed users to communicate with each other,

00:00:49.984 --> 00:00:52.399
send messages, pictures, videos,

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.085
and the web grew to handle the social interactions.

00:00:55.085 --> 00:00:58.340
Users became the creators of content and along with that,

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.730
came the growth of internet services that we all know and love such as,

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:05.929
Google, Amazon, Facebook, Uber, and even Airbnb.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.430
Now this meant that while Web 2.0 created many new opportunities for users,

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.090
the value still goes to decentralized entities.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.370
The economy of wealth and data ownership are

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.325
still dominated by these privately owned middlemen.

00:01:19.325 --> 00:01:22.070
For example, there now exist platforms

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:25.069
that opened the access for musicians to publicize their music.

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:27.844
But musicians don't get the full share of these profits.

00:01:27.844 --> 00:01:30.394
A large cuts now goes back to these app services.

00:01:30.394 --> 00:01:33.280
The publishers, the labels and collecting services.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.140
So, this brings up some of the issues with Web 2.0.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.469
Now, one of them is that outside these web service giants,

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:41.599
the internet today does not hold state.

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:43.640
Now, here's what I mean by that.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.280
In our current paradigm,

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.079
if you were to query a device that's connected to the internet

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.079
and asking about its history or its current state,

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:53.239
it has no idea what you're talking about.

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:56.884
Now, two solutions came about to address this; First,

00:01:56.885 --> 00:02:01.280
Cookies, which were invented for web apps to preserve state on the local devices.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.989
Now, the problem of cookies however,

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:07.324
is that they were created and controlled by service providers, not the user.

00:02:07.325 --> 00:02:09.995
The user does not have any control over

00:02:09.995 --> 00:02:13.550
which provider is giving them state or has access to their state.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.760
Secondly, centralized entities such as Google and

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:21.094
Facebook hold the state and thus hold the value that's created from them.

00:02:21.094 --> 00:02:23.330
Let's refer back to our musician friend earlier.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.320
So, there's no easy way for her to sell her music directly to our fans,

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.479
without going through a traditional middlemen,

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:30.949
like labels or publishers.

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:33.709
Now, there's nothing wrong with this current paradigm,

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.585
but there's definitely room for improvement.

00:02:35.585 --> 00:02:38.629
So, how is Web 3.0 looking to solve this?

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:40.789
Well, with introduction of the blockchain,

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:44.495
we now have a way for participants to hold and transfer state

00:02:44.495 --> 00:02:48.349
in a digitally native way as well as transfer the value it holds.

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.704
So this is really powerful because it allows

00:02:50.705 --> 00:02:54.380
any participant not only to be able to be the creator of the content,

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:56.569
but also benefit from its value.

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.750
Imagine instead, a world where artists can sell their music

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.169
directly to fans using cryptocurrency and then they

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:06.349
can use smart contracts to instantly split and pay at the royal

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.620
sees with no need for traditional middlemen like those labels,

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.990
publishers or collecting societies.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.635
So, that's exactly what companies like UJO music are doing.

00:03:15.634 --> 00:03:17.599
It's important to note that we're still at

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.914
the very early stages of seeing Web three unfold.

00:03:20.914 --> 00:03:24.394
There's still a lot of infrastructure and adoption that needs to happen,

00:03:24.395 --> 00:03:26.375
but the changes are taking place.

00:03:26.375 --> 00:03:29.830
Many early companies have risen up to meet the needs that we've discussed.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.575
For example, there is Steam It,

00:03:31.574 --> 00:03:33.979
which is a blogging and social networking website.

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:37.894
They uses steam blockchain to reward publishers and curators.

00:03:37.895 --> 00:03:42.350
There's also the Brave Web Browser that strips out ads from websites and

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:44.585
replaces them with their own ads and then

00:03:44.585 --> 00:03:47.390
allows users to send money to the sites that they like.

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:51.859
Check out these new players shaking up each of these spheres from the operating systems,

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.145
to messaging, to even how we work in remote jobs.

00:03:55.145 --> 00:03:56.600
In the next section,

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:58.609
we'll take a look at the architecture of Web

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.940
3.0 and see how it's propelling these changes.

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:03.770
To recap in this section,

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.860
we covered the past present and future of the internet by comparing

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.380
the changes from Web one, two to 3.0.
