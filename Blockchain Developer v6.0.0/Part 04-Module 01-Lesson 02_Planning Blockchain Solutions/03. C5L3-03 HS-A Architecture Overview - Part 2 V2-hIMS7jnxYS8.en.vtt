00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.210
In this section, we'll discuss the architecture and benefits of Web 3.0.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.130
So, to understand Web 3.0,

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.500
we need to first understand the current Web 2.0 framework.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.740
So, this is a simplified diagram which includes the client,

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.230
servers and protocols used to communicate.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.345
So, protocols such as HTTP.

00:00:18.345 --> 00:00:21.870
In order to provide the Internet away to hold and transfer state,

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.510
Web 3.0 add some key components.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.460
These include; the wallet.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.900
So, wallets are the core of how users interact with the web three applications.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.090
Wallet's allowed users to manage a user's private keys and be able to sign transactions.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.245
Wallet also interact with the main client [inaudible] and to allow a seamless user experience.

00:00:41.245 --> 00:00:44.850
An example of a Web3.js call can be a payment request.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.990
So here, a user is asked to confirm that their wallet

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.575
can send a specified amount of funds to the application's address.

00:00:51.575 --> 00:00:53.295
Once the user confirms,

00:00:53.295 --> 00:00:55.700
the front-end will present a proper message to

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.010
the user letting them know that the payment was submitted.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.965
Then, the wallet will make an RPC call.

00:01:00.965 --> 00:01:03.680
Remember that stands for remote procedure call to

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.710
the blockchain server to post the approved transaction onto the blockchain.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.475
Another component is our blockchain server.

00:01:10.475 --> 00:01:13.730
When a Wallet wants to submit a transaction to the blockchain,

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.160
or be able to query change information from the blockchain,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.830
it makes a cause and blockchain node provider.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.890
These blockchain node providers function similarly to

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.340
how AWS services run today for our back-end services.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.255
Lastly, we have our IPFS nodes.

00:01:28.255 --> 00:01:32.395
So, IPFS stands for Interplanetary File System.

00:01:32.395 --> 00:01:35.210
This is a peer-to-peer file sharing system that

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.195
changes the way that data is stored and distributed.

00:01:38.195 --> 00:01:40.700
You'll learn a lot more about this later in the course.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.270
For now, just be aware that it truly enables data to be

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.935
distributed and scale at a capacity for both clients and servers.

00:01:48.935 --> 00:01:53.755
For example, the depth that you made so far still sit on a centralized server.

00:01:53.755 --> 00:01:58.925
But you can make them truly decentralized by putting them on the IPFS server.

00:01:58.925 --> 00:02:02.315
So, while this is the current envisioning of Web 3.0,

00:02:02.315 --> 00:02:05.119
remember that we're still in the very early stages,

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.880
which makes it an exciting time to be a part of the space.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.045
You have the opportunity to help shape this new internet.

00:02:11.045 --> 00:02:13.445
So, here some questions up for discussion.

00:02:13.445 --> 00:02:16.955
Will Web 3.0 completely take over Web 2.0.

00:02:16.955 --> 00:02:19.310
Or will the two be able to coexist in some way?

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.040
If so how? Will there be DAPS that cannot be decentralized?

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.865
What about the security and privacy concerns of these newly added components?

00:02:28.865 --> 00:02:31.880
Now, hopefully these new concepts and questions have stirred up

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.030
your appetite to learn more and help build out this crazy new world.
