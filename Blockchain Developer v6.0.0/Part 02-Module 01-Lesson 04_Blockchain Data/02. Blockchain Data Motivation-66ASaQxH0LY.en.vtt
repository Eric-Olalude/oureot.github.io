00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.919
So I'm excited to start off our lesson about block data.

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:07.674
So, previously we were talking a lot about Bitcoin Core and how to use it as a tool.

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:10.199
In this lesson, we'll shift gears a bit and

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:13.169
learn about data as it relates to blocks in transactions.

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:15.480
So with that in mind, why is important to understand

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.760
blocks and transactions as data models?

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.440
Yes, the data models are extremely

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.600
important to understand because we're going to be paying

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.650
attention more and more to the protocol and every time that we look at the protocol,

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:29.519
we have rules with a way to interact with blockchain platform.

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.450
We need to understand the data model so that way we know when to relate

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.575
the data that we need with our application development efforts.

00:00:37.575 --> 00:00:39.080
So it's really important to understand

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.820
a data model so that way we can work with that data model.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.520
Interesting. So speaking of data,

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.325
I know there's ways to embed data

00:00:46.325 --> 00:00:49.445
into the Blockchain and that's actually sort of some controversy.

00:00:49.445 --> 00:00:51.570
So for example in the bitcoin platform,

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.439
some developers developed a way to embed data

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:57.744
using operation codes are what's called Op-codes into blocks.

00:00:57.744 --> 00:01:01.429
There has been a divide in the community where on one side people

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:06.790
say the Bitcoin Blockchain wasn't meant to stave off non-financial data.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.050
So, we're inflating the blockchain and

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.134
putting a heavy load on on folks who weren't intending to do it.

00:01:12.135 --> 00:01:14.500
On the other side, the community saying,

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.489
this is a way for the Blockchain to grow into spaces beyond financial sector.

00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:20.824
So, do you have thoughts on that?

00:01:20.825 --> 00:01:24.295
I do. You know it's really interesting the controversy that goes on in community.

00:01:24.295 --> 00:01:28.620
Early on, folks would actually have to burn their Bitcoin to embed data,

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.200
and this would inflate what we know as a UTXO database.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.534
So the sides would grow the ledger would be more expensive to maintain across the nodes.

00:01:38.534 --> 00:01:42.709
So, now we have a maturity existing within the protocol as

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:44.899
new improvement proposals get embedded into

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.125
the Blockchain and Op-code right like Op-return.

00:01:49.125 --> 00:01:51.319
You still can embed data but now they're

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:54.484
safeguards to help make sure that the UTXO database

00:01:54.484 --> 00:01:57.109
doesn't inflate so much that it's nearly

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:00.040
impossible for a full node to download the ledger.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.730
It's really still important to understand that the non-financial data is

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.445
really best to be separate off

00:02:07.444 --> 00:02:10.650
in regards to the ethics of the way that we're maintaining that dataset.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.300
Right. So, if we're going to create a transaction and we want to store data because we

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.620
love the immutability nature of a blockchain ledger.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.080
There's some creative ways that we still can

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.755
utilize a public Blockchain like even with Bitcoin.

00:02:24.754 --> 00:02:26.900
Well, we can take advantage that Op-return

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.430
and embed a hash to prove that transaction exists.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.650
We don't need to store a ton of data on a public ledger.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.490
You make a good point. I'm only talking about ethics, the idea of ethics.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.670
It's not commonly a topic of

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:43.030
discussion as a developer is actually a really important concepts

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.534
especially as we're developing across industries

00:02:45.534 --> 00:02:49.270
and the implications of that into those industries.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.705
So with that do you have any advice for students before they start the lesson.

00:02:52.705 --> 00:02:55.390
What you meant at a good point about like ethics,

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:56.919
just being cautious about it.

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:59.089
Anytime that we work with data,

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.430
we do want to think about

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.235
our ethical responsibility for the way that we're handling data.

00:03:04.235 --> 00:03:07.210
Something that I think a lot of people don't

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.219
recognize is the value of understanding that privacy.

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:13.625
Like we talked about before on unblocked and identity.

00:03:13.625 --> 00:03:17.479
Maintaining your identities it's extremely important,

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:20.679
and that should carry forward to the way that you do a transaction

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.750
especially when you start embedding data utilizing Blockchain services.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.969
Will be ethically responsible and maintain that dataset

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:31.199
that's going to be mutually beneficial for everybody's going to use your application.

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:33.459
Yeah. So I'm really excited to

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.240
talk more with you guys about this as the lesson continues.
