00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.290
So now that we have created a raw transaction,

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.745
we have a hex string back,

00:00:05.745 --> 00:00:07.710
we need to sign it using a valid.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.315
For this, of course we'll use the command which is called signrawtransactionwithwallet,

00:00:12.314 --> 00:00:14.459
followed by the hex string that we just got back.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.785
So we need to sign it because we haven't signed it yet.

00:00:16.785 --> 00:00:19.890
So we got this string back.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.935
So let's copy this string back again.

00:00:22.934 --> 00:00:25.099
Then you're going to type in a command.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.390
I know the screen is a little small.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.429
There's no way to zoom in in this pod right here,

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:31.579
but I'm going to have all the commands listed for you in the bottom of the screen,

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.339
and the commander to use is called

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.465
signrawtransactionwithwallet followed by the hex string.

00:00:40.465 --> 00:00:43.860
Okay. Hit Enter. Once you do that,

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:48.515
what you do is you again get this whole string back and other hex string.

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:51.049
So again like I said, once you've signed the transaction,

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:54.259
we can again make sure now with the signature part if you decode it,

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:55.789
should not be empty anymore.

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.659
So the way I'm going to make sure that this happens is you're

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:03.944
actually going to go and copy this hex string.

00:01:03.945 --> 00:01:06.030
Once you go copythishex string,

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.890
now let's go decode again.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.685
Once you decode again, I'll show you that that signature part is not empty anymore.

00:01:12.685 --> 00:01:14.924
So let's go back in our Vin.

00:01:14.924 --> 00:01:18.030
If you see, we got a script to the signed now fantastic.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.109
If you see scriptSig part,

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:20.299
has the signature right here.

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:21.859
So this means we are all set.

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:25.355
We've created raw transaction, we've signed it,

00:01:25.355 --> 00:01:27.560
now we're all ready to send this raw transaction

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.810
to the network which I will show you in the next step.
