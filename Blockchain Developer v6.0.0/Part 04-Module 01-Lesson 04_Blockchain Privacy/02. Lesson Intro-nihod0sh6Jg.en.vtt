00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.609
Welcome to lesson on Blockchain Privacy.

00:00:02.609 --> 00:00:03.884
In the previous lessons,

00:00:03.884 --> 00:00:07.619
we learned that Blockchains provide many useful features for software engineers.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.839
Blockchains provide a source of truth for

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:13.544
applications by making data transparent, immutable, and permanent.

00:00:13.544 --> 00:00:15.570
But what about the data that we want to use and

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.855
applications that we don't want to make public or can in public?

00:00:18.855 --> 00:00:22.510
Could you imagine for example storing your text messages on the blockchain?

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.890
Or how about putting your bank records come like completely open database?

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.240
Probably not. For these kinds of applications we need privacy.

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:35.960
Privacy for data means that your data is safe and completely inaccessible to others.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.530
It's also important to remember that your users data belongs to them,

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.234
and different users of your applications may want different levels of privacy.

00:00:43.234 --> 00:00:45.109
When you design applications,

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:47.119
you should empower your users by offering them

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:49.984
the choice to keep their data private whenever they want.

00:00:49.984 --> 00:00:53.479
In this lesson, you're going to learn several techniques you can

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:57.079
use to protect and enhance privacy in your Blockchain applications.

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.320
We'll start with basic hashing techniques and work

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.770
our way up to more complicated privacy techniques like Merkle trees,

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.585
ring signatures, zero-knowledge proofs, and more.

00:01:06.584 --> 00:01:07.929
By the end of this lesson,

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.590
you'll have a strong foundation your

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.275
conceptual and apply understanding of these techniques,

00:01:12.275 --> 00:01:15.355
as well as how to implement them yourself within your own work,

00:01:15.355 --> 00:01:17.930
so you can let your users use their data in

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.620
Blockchain applications without compromising privacy. Let's get started.
