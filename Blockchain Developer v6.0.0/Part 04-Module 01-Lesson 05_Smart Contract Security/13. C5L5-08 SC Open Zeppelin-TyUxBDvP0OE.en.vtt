00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In this section, we'll briefly go over a tool you might

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.804
remember from earlier in the program, OpenZeppelin.

00:00:05.804 --> 00:00:08.339
OpenZeppelin is a battle tested framework of

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:11.955
reusable smart contracts for Ethereum and a few other platforms.

00:00:11.955 --> 00:00:14.730
Their goal is to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities in

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.065
your applications by using standard tested community reviewed code.

00:00:19.065 --> 00:00:22.990
This tool will become incredibly useful as you make contracts by helping you

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:27.344
utilize code that has been tested and refined over time by security experts.

00:00:27.344 --> 00:00:28.919
If you haven't already,

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.330
now's a great time to run through

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:33.254
the installation process to start getting familiar with it.

00:00:33.255 --> 00:00:37.080
You can find directions on the homepage by clicking, "Get Started".

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.149
If you're interested, you can scroll down

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.489
the page to view a link to join their Slack channel.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.310
This is an easy way to stay involved in

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.280
the community and stay up-to-date with the latest resources.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.980
The documentation has a ton of great resources

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:51.694
you can use to get more familiar with their contracts.

00:00:51.695 --> 00:00:54.619
You can get there by clicking over here on the menu bar.

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:56.149
Scrolling down this page,

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.079
you'll see details about security, resources and collaborations.

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.184
Let's check out Access Control.

00:01:02.185 --> 00:01:05.000
Here, you'll see a contract Ownable.sol with

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.165
a very clear description of exactly how this contract was built.

00:01:08.165 --> 00:01:10.670
Take some time to read through this for yourself to get

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.030
a better idea of how the different features of this contract work.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.724
This example code only provides an idea of how to use this contract within your code.

00:01:18.724 --> 00:01:22.449
It's not actually the code provided by the ownable.sol contract.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.549
For example, you'll see here that to use this contract,

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:28.340
you'll first have to import the contract then use is

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.909
Ownable to make the function accessible by your contract.

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.359
To see the actual code provided by ownable.sol,

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:37.054
we can look at their GitHub page.

00:01:37.055 --> 00:01:40.380
To get there, you can use the link named openzeppelin-solidity,

00:01:40.379 --> 00:01:41.894
I left below the video.

00:01:41.894 --> 00:01:44.299
Here, you can read through all of the functions made

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.524
available to you when utilizing this contract for your project.

00:01:47.525 --> 00:01:49.940
These functions are all extremely secure and

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:52.314
have been tested by the OpenZeppelin community.

00:01:52.314 --> 00:01:53.995
Like we mentioned earlier though,

00:01:53.995 --> 00:01:55.880
you should always understand the contracts you're

00:01:55.879 --> 00:01:58.489
working with rather than just blindly trusting them.

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:01.819
Take some time to read through this contract to better understand

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:05.229
exactly what features it provides and how they go about doing that.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.759
One way to help understand the contract is by pasting it into the re-mix editor.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.405
This lets you get a little more hands-on with the functionality of the contract.

00:02:13.405 --> 00:02:16.090
Let's try that now with ownable.sol.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.680
Once it's in the editor,

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.960
deploy it just like any other contract.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.155
After deploying it, you should see the functions renounce ownership,

00:02:23.155 --> 00:02:26.694
transfer ownership, is owner and owner available.

00:02:26.694 --> 00:02:29.319
Trying out the features it provides is a great way to get

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.049
a sense of how they can be used for your future projects.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.275
Check back to the contract to get a better idea for what each of these functions do.

00:02:36.275 --> 00:02:40.870
All of the contracts OpenZeppelin offers are available on their GitHub page.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.465
To view all of the other contracts that are available,

00:02:43.465 --> 00:02:44.905
go back to their GitHub page,

00:02:44.905 --> 00:02:47.814
click on "Contracts" and navigate wherever you'd like.

00:02:47.814 --> 00:02:50.090
Each of these are named pretty clearly and contain

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.539
a lot of comments to help you understand what they do.

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:53.965
To better understand them,

00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:58.099
just take time for yourself to read through them and continue developing more contracts.

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:00.289
For some examples of how to use them,

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:02.239
you can go back to the documentation.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.800
Here they provide a few basic examples on crowd sales, tokens and utilities.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.870
Working through the examples in these sections

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.759
will help you get more familiar with working with

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:15.094
OpenZeppelin and help you put together more creative solutions in the future.

00:03:15.094 --> 00:03:18.580
So, that wraps up this quick introduction to OpenZeppelin.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.190
This tool will become part of many of your future smart contracts.

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:24.560
The examples they provide will be a great start to

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.039
ensure you're confident using OpenZeppelin in the future.
