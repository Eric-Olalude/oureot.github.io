00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.390
Throughout the lesson, you've been introduced to a huge range of

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.540
topics related to the security of Smart Contracts.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.019
It can be exciting to jump in and try some of this for yourself.

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.549
But before you do,

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.695
there's one more story I'd like to share.

00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:18.224
In this story, someone trying to help secure a smart contract accidentally

00:00:18.224 --> 00:00:22.964
deleted $300 million worth of a theorem. Here's what happened.

00:00:22.964 --> 00:00:25.859
As we've seen, the Tao and parody hex we're

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.980
coordinated attempts to steal money from other users.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.780
While this is a huge issue,

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.820
sometimes people with good intentions can

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.640
still cause trouble if they're not sure what they're doing.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.520
Like before, this happened on a parody wallet,

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.260
but this time was different.

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:44.554
It started with a report from a user named DevOps 199 that said,

00:00:44.554 --> 00:00:46.354
"Anyone can kill your contract."

00:00:46.354 --> 00:00:49.309
This was meant to expose a security vulnerability and

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.445
let the team know that they should address this as soon as possible.

00:00:52.445 --> 00:00:55.159
The vulnerability allowed anyone to go in,

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:58.129
make themselves the owner of the contract, and from there,

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.390
do whatever they like,

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.704
including killing the contract itself.

00:01:01.704 --> 00:01:03.850
Soon after this first message,

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.769
another message appeared from DevOps 199 saying,

00:01:06.769 --> 00:01:08.409
"I accidentally killed it."

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:12.560
At this point, the user may not have understood what they did but they just

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.865
deleted the function that allowed users to transfer either out of their wallets.

00:01:16.864 --> 00:01:20.074
The result was that about $300 million worth of

00:01:20.075 --> 00:01:23.689
Ether was locked up in the contracts with no way to transfer it,

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:25.730
making them completely useless.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.204
This resulted in one of the largest losses of a theorem ever seen on the network,

00:01:30.204 --> 00:01:32.974
and it wasn't caused by a coordinated attack.

00:01:32.974 --> 00:01:35.614
That said, after reading more about this,

00:01:35.614 --> 00:01:37.879
it seems there is some speculation on whether or

00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:40.759
not DevOps 109 knew what they were doing.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.185
Some say this was intentional, and that they have proof.

00:01:44.185 --> 00:01:45.900
Whether or not it's true,

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.755
the point that I'm trying to make is that you should be careful.

00:01:48.754 --> 00:01:50.674
Especially when first getting started,

00:01:50.674 --> 00:01:52.519
make sure you've taken the time to carefully

00:01:52.519 --> 00:01:55.399
consider the changes you're making the smart contracts.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.130
I don't mean to scare you from trying and updates

00:01:58.129 --> 00:02:00.875
the code would barely result in something that's drastic.

00:02:00.875 --> 00:02:04.670
Instead, you should make sure you've read the resources available to you,

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.100
reached out to the community and slowly work

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:10.204
UAN by joining the community of security experts.

00:02:10.205 --> 00:02:12.290
This will help you grow as a developer,

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:14.629
allow you to make some more competent decisions,

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:17.585
and will allow others to trust your expertise as you become

00:02:17.585 --> 00:02:21.460
a valued member of the Smart Contract Security Community.
