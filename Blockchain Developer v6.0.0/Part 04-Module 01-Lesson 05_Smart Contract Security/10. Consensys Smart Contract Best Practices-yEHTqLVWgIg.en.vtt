00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.835
Now that we've gone over the solidity documentation,

00:00:02.835 --> 00:00:05.040
I wanted to go over one more resource that does

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.715
an amazing job centralizing resources about these topics.

00:00:08.715 --> 00:00:11.700
ConsenSys is accompany helping technologists and

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.165
entrepreneurs as they build out ideas for a decentralized future.

00:00:15.165 --> 00:00:17.879
It's similar to an incubator like Y Combinator,

00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:19.665
but for Blockchain projects.

00:00:19.665 --> 00:00:21.345
You can check out their homepage.

00:00:21.345 --> 00:00:23.850
But what I'd like to send you to is the documentation they

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.060
keep meant to support the development of secure contracts.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.470
Down below the video,

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.700
you'll see a link to their GitHub account containing Smart Contract best practices.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.970
Within that, you'll see topics like the General Philosophy,

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.520
Recommendations, Known Attacks, and more.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.695
All meant to ensure you have a strong foundation in Smart Contract security.

00:00:42.695 --> 00:00:44.810
Personally, I've read through all of this,

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.225
and I'd recommend that you eventually do that as well.

00:00:47.225 --> 00:00:49.025
But some of this is a bit dense,

00:00:49.025 --> 00:00:51.575
some of it's redundant with other things you'll see,

00:00:51.575 --> 00:00:53.285
and some of this will cover later.

00:00:53.285 --> 00:00:58.315
For now, I'd say at least focus on the General Philosophy and the Security Notifications.

00:00:58.315 --> 00:01:00.195
Under the General Philosophy,

00:01:00.195 --> 00:01:02.510
they go over some mindsets you can develop to help you

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.270
approach development in a more security friendly way.

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.465
They've got great tips on things like preparing for failure,

00:01:08.465 --> 00:01:11.575
rolling out carefully, keeping things simple, and more.

00:01:11.575 --> 00:01:14.420
Under Security Notifications, they keep a list of

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.020
known resources where you can find discussions about known issues.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.320
As you'll see, even ConsenSys has trouble keeping up with the

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.105
absolute latest in all things about security for Smart Contracts.

00:01:25.105 --> 00:01:27.250
Their recommendation, like ours,

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.860
is to have a solid foundation of tools and resources to work from,

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.140
but to stay active in the community to continue

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.860
researching the most up-to-date knowledge in this field.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.050
So, go ahead now and read about the general philosophy and

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.575
Security Notifications provided in the ConsenSys documentation.

00:01:42.575 --> 00:01:45.335
Personally, I read the solidity documentation,

00:01:45.335 --> 00:01:49.255
Ethereum Blog and Reddit and I'm a member of the Ethereum Gitter chat rooms.

00:01:49.255 --> 00:01:52.695
If you'd like, you can join some of these communities and once you're there,

00:01:52.695 --> 00:01:54.880
maybe we'll see each other in the conversations.
