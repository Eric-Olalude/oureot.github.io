00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.089
All right, if you made it this far, congratulations.

00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:05.549
The good news is, what we've gone through to this point

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.234
is the densest of what you'll see throughout this lesson.

00:00:08.234 --> 00:00:09.779
Throughout the rest of the lesson,

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:14.339
we'll focus on the tooling available in the space that helps ensure secure contracts.

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:19.109
To start, we'll look back at the solidity documentation and the consensus documentation,

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.664
then, head over to some specific tools you might find interesting.

00:00:22.664 --> 00:00:25.004
Over in the solidity documentation,

00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:27.960
you'll find a list of tools grouped into static analysis,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.685
test coverage and Lintors.

00:00:29.684 --> 00:00:33.854
For each of them, you'll see a quick description with a link to more documentation.

00:00:33.854 --> 00:00:35.890
It's hard to know the details of each of them,

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.480
but I'd recommend at least skimming them for now to open up

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:41.569
your awareness about what's going on with each of these tools.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.500
Some of them are doing really interesting things to help the blockchain space.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.554
For example, the Oriente tool has written an entire paper on security vulnerabilities.

00:00:50.554 --> 00:00:53.659
If you click on it, you'll notice that you already know this paper.

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:57.304
It's the Making Smart Contracts Smarter paper from the last section.

00:00:57.304 --> 00:01:01.250
To start, I recommend going in and installing one of the linters for your editor.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.859
This really help when coding locally to check that you're

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:07.204
avoiding common errors and following basic design guidelines.

00:01:07.204 --> 00:01:09.709
Over on the consensus security tools page,

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:13.789
you'll see another set of tools including a decent amount of duplicate material.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.560
For example, the linters shown here are the same.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.969
Manticore is the same.

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:20.870
Solidity coverage is the same, as well as some others.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.010
One tip I use is that while it helps to at least glance at every tool you can find,

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.290
the ones that start appearing in more places are

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.830
the ones that have a little more popularity in the industry.

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:32.209
Seeing stuff linked in many places is usually

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:35.119
a good signal that is worth reading into a little further.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.730
So, these are good aggregated list of tools,

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.415
but I did want to mention one more tool again specifically.

00:01:40.415 --> 00:01:43.925
Mocha is a huge help for developing secure smart contracts.

00:01:43.924 --> 00:01:47.759
It's not listed probably because it's for testing rather than security,

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.045
but a big part of making a secure contract is making a well-tested contract.

00:01:52.045 --> 00:01:55.864
Testing with Mocha is something you'll develop a love-hate relationship with.

00:01:55.864 --> 00:01:58.079
My hope is that you love it more than hate it,

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.319
because as much as any tool I've been showing you,

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:01.789
testing early and often is

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.165
an extremely important way to ensure the security of your contract.

00:02:05.165 --> 00:02:07.875
You've gone through testing with Mocha earlier in the program,

00:02:07.875 --> 00:02:09.620
so I won't dive into the details here.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.625
This is just a reminder to keep on testing and learn to love Mocha.

00:02:13.625 --> 00:02:16.310
That wraps up this intro to places you can find some of

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.580
the latest tools and want to help improve the security of your contracts.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.780
Like I mentioned, I recommend at least testing out

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.425
the linter to help avoid common errors with your code.

00:02:24.425 --> 00:02:28.540
I used [inaudible] which works well for me while programming Visual Studio Code.
