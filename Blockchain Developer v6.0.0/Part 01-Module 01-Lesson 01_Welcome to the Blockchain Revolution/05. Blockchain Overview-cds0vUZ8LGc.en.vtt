00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.980
Now blockchains have become extremely popular, but what are they?

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.700
And how do they work? And what problems they solve?

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.140
Well, blockchain is simply a shared database that contains a list of

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.360
transactions and these transactions

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:15.334
are made between the users who become part of this network.

00:00:15.335 --> 00:00:18.255
Transaction can be something as simple as sending money.

00:00:18.254 --> 00:00:20.189
This was actually a popular use cases of

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.630
the blockchain versus established by the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.

00:00:23.629 --> 00:00:26.890
Now the idea for Bitcoin came from an unknown developer

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.315
who goes by the name Satoshi Nakamoto back in 2009,

00:00:30.315 --> 00:00:34.120
and the idea was to create a new type of currency that is open to

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:38.479
anyone and can establish the trust needed to facilitate transactions.

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:42.759
Bitcoin may have been the first blockchain but there have been many more sense,

00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:46.179
and use cases are popping up in many industries besides finance.

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:48.689
So the way that this data is created,

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:52.769
organized, and managed on a blockchain helps to do some pretty cool things.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.080
For one, blockchain data is shared by all users on this network.

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.089
It's not kept in the hands of any central authority.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.870
Secondly, it's extremely difficult to change

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:05.670
any data once it has been put onto a blockchain.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.159
Putting these two things together,

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.709
you end up with a shared perminant history of

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:13.979
transactions that we can trust to be accurate and up-to-date.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:20.215
So, how does this all work? Let's say I'm trying to send you 10 Eudacity as coins.

00:01:20.215 --> 00:01:22.490
To send these coins, we'll each need

00:01:22.489 --> 00:01:25.759
a digital wallet which you can picture as a normal wallet for now.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.594
I'll send my Eudacity coins from my wallet to yours and this we'll call a transaction.

00:01:31.594 --> 00:01:35.629
The transaction is a record of information like who sent it,

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:38.530
who were sent to and how much was sent.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.420
Next, the transaction is sent out to a network of users,

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.465
and the goal of this network is to take

00:01:44.465 --> 00:01:48.365
our transactions and group it with other transactions into a block.

00:01:48.364 --> 00:01:50.739
Once enough transactions are collected,

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:54.604
the block is full and ready to be permanently added to the blockchain.

00:01:54.605 --> 00:02:00.255
To do this, before block is assigned a unique value what's known as a hash.

00:02:00.254 --> 00:02:02.420
A hash is unique fingerprint of

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.305
inflammation that allows us to identify the block in the future.

00:02:06.305 --> 00:02:09.390
This hash is really important because it uniquely

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:12.619
identifies exactly which data was in the block.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.259
If I were to change something about our transaction, like to say,

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:18.319
I send you five Eudacity coins instead,

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.245
it will change the hash of the block making it invalid.

00:02:22.245 --> 00:02:25.469
The block is given a hash value as

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:28.280
well as the hash of the block that was created before it,

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.729
and this links the two blocks together and over time,

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:35.579
this continues to build out a longer and longer chain of blocks.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.430
As time goes on, this blockchain creates

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.814
an unchangeable historical record of

00:02:40.814 --> 00:02:44.039
all transactions that have ever happened on the network.

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:46.469
This idea has allowed us to create

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:49.984
some really exciting new applications in many different industries.

00:02:49.985 --> 00:02:54.410
Hopefully, this gives you a basic idea of what's going on on the blockchain.

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:57.884
We'll be discussing all this and more throughout the program.

00:02:57.884 --> 00:03:01.229
