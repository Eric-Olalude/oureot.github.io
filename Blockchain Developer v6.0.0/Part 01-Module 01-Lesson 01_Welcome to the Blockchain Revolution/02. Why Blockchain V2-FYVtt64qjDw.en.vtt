00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
Working in blockchain space today is actually very exciting,

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.644
and the reason is,

00:00:04.644 --> 00:00:07.924
you are basically reinventing Wall Street, right?

00:00:07.924 --> 00:00:10.410
You are automating everything that they're doing.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.964
You're turning it into code.

00:00:13.964 --> 00:00:16.679
Then you're also doing is basically building a digital economy.

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:19.015
It's amazing just to see this whole thing bootstrapping.

00:00:19.015 --> 00:00:22.914
It is as if you were born in internet era 20 to 30 years ago,

00:00:22.914 --> 00:00:26.410
and you're seeing all this information getting digitized and programmable and so on.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.414
We're seeing everything scarce becoming programmable, and that's pretty amazing.

00:00:29.414 --> 00:00:32.339
While it's challenging to certainly develop a new blockchain,

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.600
you need to know a lot of things,

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.664
and it's a difficult task for any programmer.

00:00:36.664 --> 00:00:39.079
Let's say the difficulty level there is here,

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:40.115
I think there's a lot of things that

00:00:40.115 --> 00:00:42.560
even a relatively junior person come in and contribute to.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.455
For example, building a block explorer

00:00:44.454 --> 00:00:47.214
doesn't require you to go and build a whole new blockchain.

00:00:47.215 --> 00:00:49.250
You can just use your skills as a web programmer.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.844
If you look at the space, the blockchain space,

00:00:51.844 --> 00:00:55.850
the demand for open positions is just absolutely gigantic.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.590
The supply is very limited,

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:58.915
and the reason is that,

00:00:58.914 --> 00:01:02.780
this is not taught really and K through 12 it's not really taught in college.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.659
Blockchain started with a forum post by Satoshi in 2009.

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.420
It didn't start with a top down movement

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.689
to accent let's say that mobile or other things did.

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:13.069
So it sort of crept up on people and become extremely

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:15.989
important overnight but the supply is not meeting the demand.

00:01:15.989 --> 00:01:17.929
Services like audacity or filling that gap where

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.720
traditional education does just not move fast enough to keep up.

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:21.944
For those folks who are getting trained,

00:01:21.944 --> 00:01:24.644
who do have these skills, when you've got a huge demand,

00:01:24.644 --> 00:01:25.890
and not a huge supply,

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.120
you're compensated quite well,

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.050
so it's a good time to get into blockchain because of that.
