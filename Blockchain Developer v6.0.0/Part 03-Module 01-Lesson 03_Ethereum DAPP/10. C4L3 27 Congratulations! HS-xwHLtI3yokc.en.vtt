00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.590
Congratulations.

00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:05.160
You have now designed a complete decentralized application,

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.810
also known as a DApp.

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:11.279
We started with writing this down nutri-smart contract in Remix.

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:16.004
Then, the use of Truffle boxes for the boilerplate code to write the DApp.

00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:18.464
Reported a contract to Truffle,

00:00:18.464 --> 00:00:20.969
and then we wrote many test cases to

00:00:20.969 --> 00:00:24.044
make sure a contract works the way it is intended to work.

00:00:24.045 --> 00:00:27.090
Then, we designed the front-end for the step.

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:28.739
We started the server,

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:31.244
the host of front-end for this DApp.

00:00:31.245 --> 00:00:34.740
We also make sure that a MetaMask is connected to

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.090
the private Ethereum network running on port 9545.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.980
So, we could call functions on the contract. Great job.

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:46.729
Now, we will design the second version of this contract,

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:50.479
which is the tokenized version. Let's get started.
