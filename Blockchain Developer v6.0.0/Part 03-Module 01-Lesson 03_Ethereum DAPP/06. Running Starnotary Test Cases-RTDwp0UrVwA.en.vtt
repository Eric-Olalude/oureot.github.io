00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.675
We have implemented the smart contract that's starNotary,

00:00:03.675 --> 00:00:06.165
modified the migration file,

00:00:06.165 --> 00:00:09.045
and implement the test cases.

00:00:09.045 --> 00:00:11.700
Let's run our test cases.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.745
The first thing to do is in your terminal,

00:00:14.745 --> 00:00:18.130
run the command truffle develop.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:28.185
Remember, if you installed truffle globally using the pseudo command,

00:00:28.185 --> 00:00:32.145
you will need to run the command using sudo as well.

00:00:32.145 --> 00:00:39.400
In my case, I'm going to use sudo truffle develop.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.480
If you see, I have my URL indicating that truffle

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:06.220
started on local host with the port 9545.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.660
The second step is compile your smart contract.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.690
To do that, write the command compile.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:23.995
The third step is using the migrate command, migrate reset.

00:01:23.995 --> 00:01:28.700
Always use the reset option to make sure that

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.080
you start a clean and new smart contract session.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.460
Once you have the complete the migration reset,

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.160
then you can use the test command.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:57.400
If you see, the test cases were absolutely fine, 3 passing.
