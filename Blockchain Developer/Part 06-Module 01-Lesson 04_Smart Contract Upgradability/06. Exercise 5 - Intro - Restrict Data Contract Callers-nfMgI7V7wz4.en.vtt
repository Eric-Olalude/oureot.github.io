00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
So what we do is, we create a state variable,

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.224
where we track which contracts are authorized.

00:00:06.224 --> 00:00:09.330
This assumes that they may be more than

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.530
one because you may have architected your application so there's a Data Contract,

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:15.869
and three, or more, or five App Contracts.

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:17.234
In our scenario, there is just one,

00:00:17.234 --> 00:00:19.829
so it could have just been a single variable.

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:22.669
But from an architectural standpoint,

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.825
to make this as flexible as possible,

00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:26.939
we create a mapping.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.774
We then create two functions, authorizedContract and deauthorizedContract,

00:00:32.774 --> 00:00:35.984
each of which takes a parameter that will represent

00:00:35.984 --> 00:00:39.854
the address of the deployed application contract.

00:00:39.854 --> 00:00:42.819
Now, it's very important that

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.210
both these functions be restricted to authorized users because otherwise,

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.960
it defeats the purpose of even having them.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.420
Finally, we create a function modifier IsCallerauthorized,

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.840
and the purpose of that is to check and assert every time a function

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:09.409
that is privileged or has important data that the caller is authorized to call it.

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.804
Ordinarily, you would just check to see if the user is authorized.

00:01:14.805 --> 00:01:18.900
But in this case, now the user might represent a contract.
