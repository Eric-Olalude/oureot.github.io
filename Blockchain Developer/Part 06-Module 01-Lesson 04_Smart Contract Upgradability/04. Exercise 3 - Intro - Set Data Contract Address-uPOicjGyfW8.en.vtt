00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
So let's now step into Exercise 3,

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.459
where we finally tell the data contract reference that we've set up in

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.480
the application contract about where it can find the diploid instance of the contract.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.399
So this process involves creating

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:28.679
a constructor parameter in the app contract that takes the address of the data contract,

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:31.934
and then what we do is we initialize

00:00:31.934 --> 00:00:36.329
the reference to the data contract in that same constructor.

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:43.864
So the model is a deployment of the data contract which gives you the deployed address,

00:00:43.865 --> 00:00:46.940
and then you use those references in

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:54.349
the application contract which will be deployed second or in the future again,

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.789
if it's to be replaced.

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.879
That's how the application contract always

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.910
knows where to find the data contract in its diploid state.
