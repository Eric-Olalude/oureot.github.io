00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.715
The term bitcoin is used a lot.

00:00:02.715 --> 00:00:05.220
But it's a little unclear sometimes what it means.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.665
It's mostly known as a cryptocurrency,

00:00:07.665 --> 00:00:09.460
but there's a lot more to it than that.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.000
It is generally an umbrella term used to describe everything about bitcoin.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.525
But aside from the currency,

00:00:15.525 --> 00:00:18.855
there are actually two very distinct functions of bitcoin to understand,

00:00:18.855 --> 00:00:21.695
and in this video, we'll explore these two functions.

00:00:21.695 --> 00:00:23.170
Bitcoin as a network,

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.390
and bitcoin as a software.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.545
We'll help clear up some of the confusion,

00:00:27.545 --> 00:00:30.805
and discuss how each of these two, work together.

00:00:30.805 --> 00:00:34.180
So, the term bitcoin specifically refers to

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.470
the network of bitcoin users creating and validating transactions.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.190
Aside from this network,

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.470
there's a software behind the bitcoin that makes it all work,

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.330
and this, is known as Bitcoin Core.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.660
Bitcoin Core, is an implementation of bitcoin that

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.345
encompasses all the software behind bitcoin,

00:00:52.345 --> 00:00:54.270
that allows the network to function.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.820
This is where all the developer tools environments exist.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.075
Initially, this software was published under the name bitcoin.

00:01:03.075 --> 00:01:04.615
But as the network grew,

00:01:04.615 --> 00:01:08.665
it became more important to make a distinction between the network, and the software.

00:01:08.665 --> 00:01:11.680
So, the software was renamed to Bitcoin Core,

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.295
to clear this confusion.

00:01:13.295 --> 00:01:15.470
Through its history, it's been called

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.170
Bitcoin-QT and it's sometimes referred to as the Satoshi client.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.000
So if you see these names anywhere,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.255
Keep in mind that these refer to same thing.

00:01:23.255 --> 00:01:25.070
Previously in this program,

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.290
we focused on Bitcoin as a network.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.660
But throughout this lesson,

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.500
we'll transition to Bitcoin Core,

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.190
and start to explore the tools available to you as a Bitcoin developer.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.210
There are a few essential features of Bitcoin Core, that we'll discuss.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.360
First, the Bitcoin Core transaction verification engine.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.370
This connects the Bitcoin network as a full node

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.925
allowing you to verify transactions happening in the Bitcoin network.

00:01:48.925 --> 00:01:51.070
Another feature of Bitcoin Core,

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.240
is the ability to explore and validate the entire Bitcoin blockchain,

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.130
which is a history of all those Bitcoin transactions that have taken place.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.250
Finally, it provides a cryptocurrency wallet,

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.535
that allows you to transfer Bitcoins.

00:02:04.535 --> 00:02:07.510
As a developer, you'll interact with these features using

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.010
the command line interface in the Bitcoin Core debug console.

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.840
The debug console, is a powerful tool that

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.560
allows you to interact with data on the bitcoin blockchain.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.450
And after getting up to speed with your own environments,

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.570
you'll spend a lot of time exploring data in this tool.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.500
As a developer, you also get access to other networks,

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.540
where you can test bitcoin applications in

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.440
an environment that mimics the features of a live network.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.995
And understanding these features,

00:02:32.995 --> 00:02:34.265
will allow you to get set up,

00:02:34.265 --> 00:02:36.650
and start running as a Bitcoin Core developer.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.530
We'll learn all about these features,

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:39.580
and how to implement them,

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.660
throughout the rest of this lesson.
