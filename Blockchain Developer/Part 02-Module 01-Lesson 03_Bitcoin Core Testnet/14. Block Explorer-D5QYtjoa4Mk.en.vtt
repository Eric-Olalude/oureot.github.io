00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
Now that we're making transactions for ourselves,

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.470
we can check out the details of them using an online block explorer.

00:00:06.469 --> 00:00:10.230
In this video, we'll find the transaction we just made

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.734
and go over some important details of a Bitcoin TestNet Block Explorer.

00:00:14.734 --> 00:00:18.119
There are few options that you can use to explore block chains,

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.815
and there are reasons that you may end up with

00:00:19.815 --> 00:00:22.570
a specific preference of one over another in the future.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.260
But for now, we'll be using this one for

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.315
the website blockcypher.com because it has everything that we need.

00:00:29.315 --> 00:00:32.810
You can get there using the link that we've put down below this video.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.484
Before looking at your transaction,

00:00:34.484 --> 00:00:36.445
it helps to know what's going on here.

00:00:36.445 --> 00:00:40.549
First, check to make sure that you're on the Bitcoin TestNet.

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:46.649
To do so, click on the drop-down and select Bitcoin TestNet from the list of options.

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.420
Once you're on the TestNet,

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.585
you will see that the page is broken into three main sections;

00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:55.509
Recent Blocks, current Fee Estimates,

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:57.434
and the Latest Transactions.

00:00:57.435 --> 00:01:01.725
For the Recent Blocks, you'll see things like the height, the age,

00:01:01.725 --> 00:01:05.090
number of transactions, total Bitcoins sent,

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.105
total fees, and the block size.

00:01:08.105 --> 00:01:11.040
These are hopefully pretty familiar attributes by now.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.355
Notice that the height is always increasing by one,

00:01:14.355 --> 00:01:17.390
and the age of each is more recent than the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.079
last and that's because it's listing each block in the order that they're being created.

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:26.359
The total amount sent and the fees are

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:29.814
dependent on what was specified by the user making the transaction.

00:01:29.814 --> 00:01:34.390
The transactions and the size are related to one another.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.454
More transactions in the block means more data is stored on the block,

00:01:38.454 --> 00:01:40.474
which results in a larger block.

00:01:40.474 --> 00:01:44.669
Scrolling down, you'll see the current fee estimates.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.905
This is a way to see the proximate cause of making transactions on the network.

00:01:49.905 --> 00:01:51.695
This isn't too important right now,

00:01:51.694 --> 00:01:53.844
since these are all just TestNet coins,

00:01:53.844 --> 00:01:55.885
but as you start making applications,

00:01:55.885 --> 00:01:58.329
the transaction fee can definitely impact the way

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:01.390
users might send and receive Bitcoins with your app.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.420
Finally, down at the bottom here,

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.710
you'll see the latest transactions that have been made on the Test Network.

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:11.609
Now, if you were to go to this site quick enough right off you send your transaction,

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.115
you might be able to see your transactions on the list.

00:02:14.115 --> 00:02:16.590
But if it's not there that's totally fine,

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.015
you can always look at your transaction using the search bar here.

00:02:20.014 --> 00:02:21.729
Let's go ahead and do that now.

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:23.259
To search for your transaction,

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:25.504
you need the transaction ID.

00:02:25.504 --> 00:02:27.384
So, back in the wallet here,

00:02:27.384 --> 00:02:29.655
go to the Transactions tab,

00:02:29.655 --> 00:02:32.159
and then right-click on the transaction that

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:34.275
you'd like to search for on the Block Explorer.

00:02:34.275 --> 00:02:38.569
Select the option Copy Transaction ID,

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.280
and then navigate back to the Block Explorer,

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.189
and then paste this ID into the search bar, and then click Search.

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:50.134
Here, you'll see all the details of your transaction,

00:02:50.134 --> 00:02:52.959
with things like the amount, the fees,

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.469
the time, and the number of confirmations it has received.

00:02:56.469 --> 00:03:00.155
The advanced details shows you things like the block hash,

00:03:00.155 --> 00:03:03.365
height, the index, and a number of other details.

00:03:03.365 --> 00:03:06.195
Scrolling further down, you'll see the detail section.

00:03:06.194 --> 00:03:10.709
This gives a breakdown of the transactions inputs and outputs.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.400
You can see that the original transaction was initiated by sending this much,

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.385
but then only the amount requested was sent,

00:03:18.384 --> 00:03:22.424
and the remaining amount was given back to the sender as change.

00:03:22.425 --> 00:03:24.980
So, that's most everything that you need to know about

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:27.574
finding your transaction on the Block Explorer.

00:03:27.574 --> 00:03:30.739
This is a good tool for navigating the network and getting

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.040
a good idea of the structure of data available on the block chain.

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:38.009
Keep in mind that all of this data can be access programmatically as well.

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:39.409
Now, as you look around,

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:41.569
think about how you might want to use some of

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:45.280
this information in upcoming applications as you build.
