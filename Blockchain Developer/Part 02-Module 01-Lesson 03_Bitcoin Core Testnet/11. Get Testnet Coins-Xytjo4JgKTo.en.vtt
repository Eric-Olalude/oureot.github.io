00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680
While it's exciting to have a test network up and running,

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.130
we can't do much if we can't make any transactions.

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:10.855
To make transactions, we'll need test net coins.

00:00:10.855 --> 00:00:12.620
To get these coins,

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:18.064
either someone could send them to you or you can go to what's known as a public faucet.

00:00:18.065 --> 00:00:20.970
In this video, we'll walk you through the steps to

00:00:20.969 --> 00:00:24.179
help you get test net coins using a public faucet.

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:26.550
By following the steps in this video,

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.660
you'll have your first coins available in your Bitcoin core wallet.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.280
A Bitcoin faucet is a website that gives rewards in the form of Bitcoin.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.579
These faucets exists on both the test net and the main net.

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.714
So yes, you can go to a faucet and get actual Bitcoins right now,

00:00:44.715 --> 00:00:46.665
but they don't give you very much.

00:00:46.664 --> 00:00:48.030
It's actually so little,

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.445
it's not actually worth your effort if you're thinking of doing this for profit.

00:00:51.445 --> 00:00:55.079
On the test net, none of these coins have any value.

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.839
So, you can use a faucet to get a decent amount of

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.645
test coins to facilitate your test transactions.

00:01:00.645 --> 00:01:02.190
Let's go ahead and do that.

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:06.000
To start, load up your wallet in the test network.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.950
Remember that you can do this by typing in testnet equals one

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.355
in your Bitcoin.configuration file and then restarting your application.

00:01:14.355 --> 00:01:15.890
Once inside your wallet,

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.079
checkout the overview page to see how much Bitcoin you currently have.

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:23.129
Now, unless you've been messing around with your wallet previously,

00:01:23.129 --> 00:01:24.420
like I have here,

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.665
you probably see that you have a balance of zero,

00:01:26.665 --> 00:01:28.575
and there should be no transactions.

00:01:28.575 --> 00:01:30.689
Now, before we can receive testnet coins,

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.599
we need to copy a receiving address from your Bitcoin wallet.

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:37.784
To do this, go to file,

00:01:37.784 --> 00:01:40.299
and then receiving addresses.

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:43.420
If you don't have any addresses here already,

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.140
you can always create a new one by clicking the "New" button.

00:01:47.519 --> 00:01:50.109
Give a label for your address.

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:53.545
I'm going to name mine here "Public faucet

00:01:53.545 --> 00:02:01.519
test" and then hit "OK".

00:02:01.519 --> 00:02:07.280
Once this is created, right-click on the address and select "Copy address".

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.545
We'll be pacing this address into the public faucet that we're about to visit.

00:02:13.544 --> 00:02:16.079
Now faucets come and go and there's not really

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.335
any one place that everyone should go to get their test coins.

00:02:19.335 --> 00:02:21.439
If you ever do you need to though,

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:26.715
you can always search for the phrase testnet faucet and then just find one that you like.

00:02:26.715 --> 00:02:31.575
But for now, I like this one here provided by the Bitcoin testnet sandbox.

00:02:31.574 --> 00:02:34.939
We provided a link to this faucet down below the video.

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:38.954
And it also comes up as one of the first options when you do search in Google.

00:02:38.955 --> 00:02:40.445
Alright. So, another way here,

00:02:40.444 --> 00:02:42.334
getting coins is really easy.

00:02:42.335 --> 00:02:47.890
All you need to do is paste your receiving address into the space provided here.

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:55.490
If there's a capture that says "I'm not a robot", go ahead and click that.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.985
I don't have one here already because I already used this.

00:02:58.985 --> 00:03:00.750
Then click "Give me some coins."

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.650
This starts the transaction and

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.569
testnet coins should be available in your wallet just shortly.

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:11.294
There's a couple of things I want you to know about this website before we leave.

00:03:11.294 --> 00:03:13.469
First, like we mentioned,

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:16.824
there's a limited number of test coins that do exist.

00:03:16.824 --> 00:03:18.729
Even though they have no value,

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:22.409
there are a way for the community to have access to coins that they can test with.

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:25.449
Now because of that, you'll notice that there's a receiving address

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:29.134
down here that you can send these tests coins back to when you're done.

00:03:29.134 --> 00:03:32.620
In doing so, it helps the community and it's really useful that's your

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.780
send your coins back that you're no longer using back to this address.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.280
This will allow other developers to have the same access that you do right

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.500
now and help avoid the need to create a whole new testnet for in the future.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.669
Secondly, if you saw the capture or the clicking "I'm not a robot"

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:51.789
is to avoid spammers from taking

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:55.370
all the testnet coins by quickly submitting requests over and over.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.430
You can also scroll down on the site to

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.200
see a list of the previous transactions that have been made.

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:03.939
Now, there's nothing too interesting here but it's worth mentioning.

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:08.550
Finally, you'll see the current balance of the wallet that is distributing

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:14.719
the test coins as well as the amount that you'll receive by having made the request.

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:18.004
Alright. So, back in the wallet. Here you might see

00:04:18.004 --> 00:04:21.379
the pending request or it might have confirmed already.

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:25.779
If not, it might take a little bit longer but if there really does seem to be a problem,

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:27.919
check that you've submitted the correct receiving

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.145
address and then try again if you haven't received any coins.

00:04:31.144 --> 00:04:32.534
Here in the overview page,

00:04:32.535 --> 00:04:36.245
we can see the recent transaction that's adding the testnet coins to your account.

00:04:36.245 --> 00:04:39.925
You'll also see that your available balance has increased,

00:04:39.925 --> 00:04:42.220
which is now reflected in your total balance.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.860
All right. So, that wraps it up for how to get

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.455
access to test coins using a public faucet.

00:04:46.454 --> 00:04:48.870
There were some extra details in here throughout the video

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.220
since it was our first time walking through this so,

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.780
it did take a little bit longer.

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:56.019
In the future, remember all you need to do is paste

00:04:56.019 --> 00:04:59.759
your receiving address into the faucet and you should quickly get some new coins.

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:04.719
Coming up, we'll put these coins to use by making our first wallet transaction.
