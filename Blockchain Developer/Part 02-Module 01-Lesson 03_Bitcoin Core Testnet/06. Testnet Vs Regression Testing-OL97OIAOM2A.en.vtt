00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.410
We just took an in-depth look at the difference between the Mainnet and the Testnet.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.150
Throughout this program, we'll be using the Testnet to build our application.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.570
Before fully committing to this network,

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.745
it's important to also understand what the Regnet is.

00:00:15.744 --> 00:00:20.199
We thought it might be helpful to lay out a comparison between these two networks,

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:25.134
then justify why we've chosen to use the Testnet for application.

00:00:25.135 --> 00:00:29.460
In this video, we'll compare the Testnet and the Regnet to get

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.530
a better understanding of what the differences

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.450
are that exists between these two networks.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.040
As we know, the Testnet is

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:41.909
a development environment meant to allow developers to test their application.

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:47.879
An alternative network known as the Regnet is also a local testing environment.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.205
The difference is that on the Regnet,

00:00:50.204 --> 00:00:55.060
developers can almost instantaneously generate blocks on demand for testing.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.570
They can create private coins with no real-world value.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.754
For our comparison, we'll run down the list of these eight characteristics.

00:01:04.754 --> 00:01:07.339
First, for each of these networks,

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.829
the purpose is for testing applications.

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:13.310
Nothing here is connected to the main live network,

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.984
they're just tools for development.

00:01:15.984 --> 00:01:18.578
Even though they're both retesting,

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:21.799
there is a major distinction between these two networks.

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:23.329
While the Testnet is

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:27.900
a public test environment with transactions that are broadcasted throughout the network,

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.250
the Regnet is completely private and transactions are only seen on your local computer.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.284
This is possible because there are no peers on the Regnet.

00:01:38.284 --> 00:01:41.239
Transactions do not go through validation and

00:01:41.239 --> 00:01:44.319
there are no peers whose transactions you'll interact with.

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:50.334
This lack of transactions means that the size is very small in comparison to the Testnet.

00:01:50.334 --> 00:01:53.309
On the Regnet, you can only download

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.368
the core components necessary to run the application,

00:01:56.368 --> 00:02:01.040
and it only grows in size as you create more blocks and transactions yourself.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.900
That's much different than the Testnet where you

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.050
have to sync to the network and download the blocks.

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.034
Since there are no peers and there's no validation,

00:02:11.034 --> 00:02:12.479
blocks aren't going through

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:16.744
the same transaction lifecycle on the Regnet as they do in other networks.

00:02:16.745 --> 00:02:18.930
Instead, on the Regnet,

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.135
you can generate any number of blocks instantaneously,

00:02:22.134 --> 00:02:24.814
reducing the block time to zero.

00:02:24.814 --> 00:02:27.509
In both the Testnet and the Regnet,

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:29.514
their coins have no value.

00:02:29.514 --> 00:02:31.250
However on the Regnet,

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.900
it hasn't had the same problem with people trying to sell their coins as the Tester

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.789
has and that's because even though both are worthless coins,

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:40.859
the Regnet coins aren't even connected to

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.095
a network that you could try to sell them even if you wanted to.

00:02:44.094 --> 00:02:48.250
Either way, don't try to sell either of these coins, they're just for testing.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.409
Another similarity between these networks is that the public keys are

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:57.194
preceded with an m or n to differentiate them from the Mainnet.

00:02:57.194 --> 00:02:59.259
Finally as we mentioned,

00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:02.424
blocks on the Regnet are created instantaneously.

00:03:02.425 --> 00:03:05.070
Since there are no nodes and no hashing,

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.659
there's also no block difficulty.

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:10.270
That wraps it up for some of the differences between

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.250
these two networks across these characteristics.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.219
There are times that you'll want to use

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:19.074
the Testnet and other times where the Regnet is better suited.

00:03:19.074 --> 00:03:21.609
It's actually common to hear that the Regnet is

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.905
a better environment for testing applications.

00:03:23.905 --> 00:03:26.140
It's true that it does allow you to do

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:29.344
some things much faster than when using the Testnet.

00:03:29.344 --> 00:03:33.990
But we've chosen to move forward with the Testnet for a very specific reason.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.820
We've chosen the Testnet because we're doing more than developing on the blockchain.

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.444
We're developing a Web service that takes

00:03:41.444 --> 00:03:45.794
user input to test and verify transactions from users.

00:03:45.794 --> 00:03:48.599
Since we'll be testing these applications with

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:51.424
the Web service and collecting user information,

00:03:51.425 --> 00:03:54.635
we'll need to be able to interact with these users.

00:03:54.634 --> 00:03:57.219
For that reason, we're choosing to stick with

00:03:57.219 --> 00:04:00.449
the Testnet even though it's a little slower in some cases.

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:03.060
Hopefully now you have a better idea of what

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.925
the Testnet is used for and what the Regnet is used for,

00:04:05.925 --> 00:04:10.050
and why we are using the Testnet as our testing environment.
