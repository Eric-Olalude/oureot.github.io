00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.370
A Bitcoin Core 4 Full Node Wallet is

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.294
a Bitcoin wallet that fully validates transactions and blocks.

00:00:06.294 --> 00:00:08.004
By downloading a full node,

00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:10.960
you'll be acting as a node that accepts and validates

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.475
both transactions and blocks from the Bitcoin blockchain.

00:00:14.474 --> 00:00:17.640
Now being a node is different than being a minor.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.660
By downloading this wallet,

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.765
you're not participating in block mining,

00:00:21.765 --> 00:00:24.824
instead you're only acting as a client that is continuously

00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:28.905
downloading and validating the blockchain using your local computer.

00:00:28.905 --> 00:00:31.470
So to download a full node wallet,

00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:35.560
go to Bitcoin.org, which I've linked down below this video.

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:41.429
From there, scroll down to the section called "Get Started with Bitcoin."

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.810
This takes you to a page where you can select

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.344
a variety of ways to get started with Bitcoin.

00:00:52.344 --> 00:00:55.369
Right now, let's click on "Choose Your Wallet."

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.040
From here, you can see a selection of wallets that you can

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:03.429
download and we'll be using Bitcoin Core.

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:06.340
From this menu, select the device and

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.350
operating system that you'll be using to install the software.

00:01:09.349 --> 00:01:12.609
For me, I'll be downloading onto my Mac.

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:19.079
Here we have the option to install or to see the source code.

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.495
In this case, I'd like to install software.

00:01:21.495 --> 00:01:25.545
Now before downloading, decide the location you'd like to store your wallet.

00:01:25.545 --> 00:01:27.840
You can store this any where you like,

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.915
just make sure that you have the space available on your device.

00:01:30.915 --> 00:01:33.390
Now Bitcoin Core can be quite a large file,

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.579
over 100 gigabytes, which can

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.000
easily overwhelm the space that you might have on your computer.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.870
Now it is possible to reduce the space taken up either using

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.210
a technique known as pruning or by syncing to the test net or the reg net.

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:51.559
Alternatively, some people would download the wallet to an external hard drive.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.299
This allows them to access the data without needing to worry that

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.959
the space on the computer will fill up as the blockchain continues to grow.

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:59.714
Once you've installed the wallet,

00:01:59.715 --> 00:02:02.760
you'll see that your computer begins syncing to the network.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.005
This is your computer taking the time to download the Bitcoin blockchain.

00:02:07.004 --> 00:02:10.754
So as progress is made, you can see the number of blocks left,

00:02:10.754 --> 00:02:12.764
when the last block was created,

00:02:12.764 --> 00:02:16.229
the progress made toward downloading the entire network,

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:21.549
and finally how much time is left until you fully sync to the entire version of watching.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.270
As I mentioned before, if you just don't

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.775
have the space available to download the entire network,

00:02:26.775 --> 00:02:31.594
you also have the option to either sync to the test network or to the regression network.

00:02:31.594 --> 00:02:36.830
We cover how to access these networks in a concept titled "Bitcoin Core Networks."

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.460
If you'd like, jump to that next for

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.800
an overview of how to get access to one of these networks.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.925
These do come with certain limitations but

00:02:45.925 --> 00:02:48.570
they're extremely useful depending on what your goals are.

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.254
So both of these options are better than having no access to the network.

00:02:52.254 --> 00:02:56.799
So see if these could be a better fit in a case where you don't have available space.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.780
Finally, while syncing to the network can take some time,

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.175
the good news is that you don't need to have

00:03:03.175 --> 00:03:06.105
all of the data in sync before you start using the wallet.

00:03:06.104 --> 00:03:08.719
Once you have any information to sync to your computer,

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:10.719
you can start exploring it for yourself.

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:15.169
Coming up, we'll explore our new wallet it just a little further.
