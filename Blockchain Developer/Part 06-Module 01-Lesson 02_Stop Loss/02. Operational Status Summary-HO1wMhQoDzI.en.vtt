00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.290
All right. With that done,

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:06.990
let's continue and review what we've learned so far in this course.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.375
First of all, we learned a simple technique but

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:12.314
a powerful one for pausing smart contracts.

00:00:12.314 --> 00:00:15.929
We learned how to avoid lockouts.

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.600
I just want to put a reminder there.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.250
It is very helpful that in all your tests you always include

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.634
a scenario for testing for lockout because once your contract is deployed, it's too late.

00:00:28.635 --> 00:00:34.149
So you want to make sure you catch those bugs during testing and development.
