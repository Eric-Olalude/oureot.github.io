00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.845
So here's how we're going to do it.

00:00:01.845 --> 00:00:07.200
The first thing is, we're going to implement three of five or two of

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.185
five depending on the requirement multi-party consensus.

00:00:13.185 --> 00:00:15.359
So in our scenario we're going to define

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:19.410
a few contract administrators when the contract is deployed.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.740
Then we're going to add three of five control,

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:27.029
and what we will do is ignore repeat function calls by the same administrator.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.589
We'll also add a test to validate that this particular code works.

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:34.649
Now, this is one approach to the solution.

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.839
I'll also talk about a second approach.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.095
If you'd like you can defer having

00:00:40.094 --> 00:00:44.839
the administrators defined at the point of the contract deployment.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.670
You can create a function that registers and un-registers users.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.870
In fact, we have just such a function already setup in the contract,

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:55.579
so you may want to use that.

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.274
So the goal of the exercise is to control

00:01:00.274 --> 00:01:06.875
the operating status variable with a three of five multi-party consensus.

00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:08.719
Now I say three or five here,

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:12.950
but the moment you have it as any number greater than one the solution will work,

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.704
so you could do two of three,

00:01:14.704 --> 00:01:18.569
you could also do three of four and so on and so forth.
