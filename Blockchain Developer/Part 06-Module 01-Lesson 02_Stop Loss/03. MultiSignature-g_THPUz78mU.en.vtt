00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.169
Let's move on to the next topic which is multi-party consensus.

00:00:04.169 --> 00:00:08.609
We'll start off by defining what is multi-signature which is an integral part of that.

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:14.204
So blockchains such as Bitcoin support multi-signature accounts,

00:00:14.205 --> 00:00:16.754
they are typically called multisig.

00:00:16.754 --> 00:00:22.125
What's unique about these accounts is that they have multiple private keys.

00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:27.359
You'll hear them described as M-of-N accounts.

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.780
So N is the number of private keys that are

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.890
possibly available for that particular account,

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.350
and M is the number of required keys for a particular transaction.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.575
A typical standard address will thus have an M of one and an N of one,

00:00:46.575 --> 00:00:49.179
so it would be 1-of-1.

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:53.299
There are several benefits of having multisignature.

00:00:53.299 --> 00:01:00.259
The first one is, it prevents theft of funds by individual bad actors.

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:06.379
Since multisig addresses require multiple private keys,

00:01:06.379 --> 00:01:09.604
it implies multiple users to perform a transaction,

00:01:09.605 --> 00:01:17.865
no single individual can perform a transaction that might involve moving funds, etc.

00:01:17.864 --> 00:01:22.310
The next thing is it protects against the loss of an individual private key.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.894
Typically, if you have a single signature account,

00:01:27.894 --> 00:01:32.045
if you lose the private key there is no way to get access to

00:01:32.045 --> 00:01:36.469
any of the funds or performing a transactions associated with that account.

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:38.299
But with a multiset key,

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.230
assuming that there are others available who have the private key,

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.465
it's easy to mitigate that problem.

00:01:44.465 --> 00:01:50.120
Finally, many businesses in the off blockchain world have

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.520
business rules that require

00:01:52.519 --> 00:01:54.349
certain financial transactions with

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:57.604
certain limits to have multiple parties that authorize it.

00:01:57.605 --> 00:02:04.780
So a multisignature account is an ideal way to enforce such business rules.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.895
So let's take another quick quiz.

00:02:08.895 --> 00:02:15.400
So what does M-of-N address mean?
