00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.665
After generating the ZoKrates portion of the app which will

00:00:04.665 --> 00:00:10.560
auto-generate the verifier contract required to complete this project,

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.255
one of the only files that you'll have to alter is the square.code file.

00:00:15.255 --> 00:00:19.905
This is a simple proof written in the ZoKrates language.

00:00:19.905 --> 00:00:25.250
You aren't expected to study this or write in elaborate proof,

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.895
we pretty much already wrote a very simple and basic proof for you.

00:00:29.895 --> 00:00:34.110
All you have to do is go through and plug in the variable names,

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.320
and the variable name for each field is

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.840
just the first word or in this case, the first character.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.990
So this result, this is a,

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.165
this is a as well,

00:00:45.165 --> 00:00:48.155
this is b, and this is result.

00:00:48.155 --> 00:00:55.565
If you want to research further on making more complex proofs to verify different things.

00:00:55.565 --> 00:00:59.510
Then you can go ahead to the ZoKrates site in the link

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.719
that's listed throughout the project walkthroughs,

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.420
and you can review different types of proofs that you can write,

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.850
but for this, we are using a very simple basic proof.
