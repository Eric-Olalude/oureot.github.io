00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.995
We're now going to review a list of ten security best practices.

00:00:04.995 --> 00:00:07.500
While we are discussing these best practices in

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.125
the context of payments, receiving, transferring,

00:00:10.125 --> 00:00:13.095
sending, keep in mind that these are

00:00:13.095 --> 00:00:16.875
generally accepted good practices for smart contracts.

00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:21.824
So it's not necessary that you only use these in the context of payments.

00:00:21.824 --> 00:00:26.265
You should as a rule use these for all your smart contracts.

00:00:26.265 --> 00:00:28.500
Let's start with number one.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.170
Keep functions private or internal unless they are needed outside your contract.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.210
When it comes to smart contracts,

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.679
the scope of your variables and functions is very important.

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:45.140
While all data on the block chain is public,

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.219
you want to make sure that certain functions especially those that handle

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:51.920
payment transactions are either private or

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.270
internal unless they are required to be called by an external entity.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.055
By keeping them private or internal you can ensure that

00:01:00.054 --> 00:01:05.799
an external party cannot inadvertently call that function and cause harm.
