00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.639
Fallback functions should be kept short and you should also

00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:11.384
check that the property message data length equals zero.

00:00:11.384 --> 00:00:15.119
Ordinarily, you would never check for this in a fallback function.

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:19.274
But remember, fallback functions are the one place in your contract

00:00:19.274 --> 00:00:22.649
where any ether that is being

00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:26.294
sent to the contract that is not captured by a specific function,

00:00:26.295 --> 00:00:29.630
it's sent to the fallback function if it's payable.

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:34.250
It's possible that a malicious user might try to manipulate

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:41.164
your contract by changing the state of the contract using message data.

00:00:41.164 --> 00:00:43.640
It's always a good idea to make sure that

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.280
the length is zero because there is never a circumstance

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.260
where a payable fallback function requires message data.

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:54.500
So in general, make sure you require that that's zero

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.570
before you proceed with the transaction.
