00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.509
Next, we want to prefix all calls to external contracts with untrusted.

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.869
As you are developing your smart contract you will encounter

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:13.214
scenarios where you are calling out to other contracts.

00:00:13.214 --> 00:00:16.410
Every variable and every function call that touches

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.324
that external contract should be prefixed with untrusted.

00:00:20.324 --> 00:00:23.820
This ensures that as you're writing your unit tests or you're

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.269
just writing code you will be aware or rather

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.230
hyper-aware that the code or the values that you are

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.619
dealing with should not be trusted and should be defensively protected against.

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:42.909
So you would require statements more aggressively when handling untrusted functions.
