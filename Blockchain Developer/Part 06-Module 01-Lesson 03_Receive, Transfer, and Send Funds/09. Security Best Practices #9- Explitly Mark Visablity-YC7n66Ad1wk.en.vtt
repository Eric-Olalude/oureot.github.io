00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280
Explicitly mark visibility of functions and state variables.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.245
We discussed earlier how

00:00:07.245 --> 00:00:11.949
public and private information is always public on the blockchain.

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:17.489
However, by marking functions and state variables with a certain visibility,

00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:23.684
you can ensure that no function or no state variable can be directly manipulated.

00:00:23.684 --> 00:00:27.570
For example, if you have a variable that is

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.769
intended to be private but is not marked as such,

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.250
it would be possible for an external contract to change that value,

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.670
and that is a highly undesirable action.
