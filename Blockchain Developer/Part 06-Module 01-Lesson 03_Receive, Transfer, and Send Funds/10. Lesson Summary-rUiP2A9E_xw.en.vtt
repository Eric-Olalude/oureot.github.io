00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.234
Let's summarize what we learned in this lesson.

00:00:02.234 --> 00:00:07.410
We started off by reviewing your knowledge of ether and payment fundamentals,

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.400
but we added the veneer of security to it.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.865
We then looked at the safe math library,

00:00:14.865 --> 00:00:17.324
understood when it needs to be used,

00:00:17.324 --> 00:00:21.585
and why it is necessary to use such a library.

00:00:21.585 --> 00:00:26.039
We then looked at three different design patterns that

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.375
can be used to protect payment related transactions and functions,

00:00:30.375 --> 00:00:34.530
and finally, we reviewed 10 best practices for protecting

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.579
your smart contracts from a wide variety of attacks and problems.
