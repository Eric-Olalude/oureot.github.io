00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.285
Let's start with our first topic, Ether Fundamentals.

00:00:03.285 --> 00:00:06.360
As you have noted in prior lessons,

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.790
Ether or ETH as the symbol is,

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:11.774
the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum blockchain,

00:00:11.775 --> 00:00:16.695
one Ether is 10 raised to the power of 18 wei.

00:00:16.695 --> 00:00:22.170
So one of the key concepts that you should bring into this lesson,

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.070
is that on Ethereum there are two types of accounts.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.365
There are contract accounts,

00:00:28.364 --> 00:00:30.869
which may receive and hold funds,

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.689
but cannot send funds without code.

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:36.884
The reason is they do not have a private key.

00:00:36.884 --> 00:00:40.949
The other type of account is an externally owned account,

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.370
which can receive, hold and send

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:47.789
funds and the reason for that is it does have a private key.
