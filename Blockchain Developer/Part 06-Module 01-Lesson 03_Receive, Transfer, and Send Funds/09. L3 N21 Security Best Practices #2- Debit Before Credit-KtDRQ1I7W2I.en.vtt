00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.615
Our next best practice is called debit before credit.

00:00:06.615 --> 00:00:10.664
In general, when handling any kind of financial transaction,

00:00:10.664 --> 00:00:15.584
always deduct the amount or debit before

00:00:15.585 --> 00:00:20.955
you credit the amount or add to minimize the risk of re-entrance attacks.

00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:25.574
We looked at some patterns earlier in this lesson that just did exactly that.

00:00:25.574 --> 00:00:29.384
A good way to remember it is to just remember the initials DC.

00:00:29.385 --> 00:00:32.020
So it's debit before credit.
