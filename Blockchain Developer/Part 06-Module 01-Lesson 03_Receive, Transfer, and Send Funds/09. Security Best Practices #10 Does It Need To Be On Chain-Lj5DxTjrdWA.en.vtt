00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.964
Finally, and the last security best practice is to always,

00:00:04.964 --> 00:00:07.699
always ask yourself the question,

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.160
does it really need to be on chain.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:17.179
Keep in mind, blockchain is not a database that is intended for fast access.

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:21.899
It is a slow database and it is expensive to store information on there.

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:24.529
As you are architecting your smart contract,

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.220
you should consider how you partition your data and make sure that you

00:00:28.219 --> 00:00:32.585
only put on the blockchain the data that needs to belong there.

00:00:32.585 --> 00:00:36.344
A good use of services such as IPFS,

00:00:36.344 --> 00:00:41.075
the InterPlanetary File System or even regular databases whether it's

00:00:41.075 --> 00:00:48.480
SQL server or any other database would be good for data that does not belong on chain.
