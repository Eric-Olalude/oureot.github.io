00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.645
Our next best practice tip is about time.

00:00:03.645 --> 00:00:05.429
Frequently in your contracts,

00:00:05.429 --> 00:00:08.160
you will deal with time-sensitive operations.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.039
Keep in mind that the now keyword is a synonym for block timestamp,

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:16.394
and can be manipulated by miners.

00:00:16.394 --> 00:00:20.175
So you should not use it in any scenario where

00:00:20.175 --> 00:00:25.335
the time variable causes funds to be moved,

00:00:25.335 --> 00:00:27.120
funds to be transferred etc.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.785
without making sure that you have checked all the other conditions also.

00:00:31.785 --> 00:00:38.480
Miners, especially in contracts that involve gambling, gaming, etc.

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:43.609
might manipulate that in order to cause financial benefit for themselves.

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:48.829
So it's very important that you code defensively when using any time operation.

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.155
It's also important to remember that time,

00:00:53.155 --> 00:00:55.535
when it comes to the context of Smart Contract,

00:00:55.534 --> 00:00:58.114
should not be used for random number generation.

00:00:58.115 --> 00:01:00.590
This is a typical thing you would do in other scenarios,

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.400
but it's definitely not something you want to do when it comes to Blockchain.
