00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.665
Our next best practice is another contract

00:00:04.665 --> 00:00:09.210
may use "delegatecall" to call your contract function.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.245
Be aware of this and code defensively.

00:00:13.244 --> 00:00:15.509
Let's parse that a little bit,

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.920
when your contract exists and is deployed to the block chain,

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.120
it's possible that it's being called by a user account

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.710
or an externally owned account as we referred to them or a smart contract.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.565
We also learned how you can distinguish between the two.

00:00:31.565 --> 00:00:35.149
If a smart contract is calling your function,

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:40.909
there is potential for harm to be done because it's actually code that is being run.

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:45.229
When this happens, it's important that you code defensively.

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:49.289
Some of the patterns we just learned will help you do just that.
