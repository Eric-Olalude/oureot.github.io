00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
Let's walk through the solution for the Rate Limiting exercise.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.740
So the exercise was to provide the code for

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.750
the modifier that would rate limit any function that uses that modifier.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.949
The require line in this code indicates that

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.600
the block timestamp should be greater than or equal to the value of enabled.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.760
So this is essentially the check that makes sure that the function cannot be called

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.160
if the elapsed time does not match the delta that is required,

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:33.750
in this case, 30 minutes.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.880
So it's very simple, call

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.835
the required statement and immediately after calling it, increment the time.

00:00:40.835 --> 00:00:44.285
Note that when I increment the time enabled equals enabled,

00:00:44.284 --> 00:00:46.759
I use the add method,

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:49.504
that is, from the SafeMath library to ensure

00:00:49.505 --> 00:00:53.000
that there are no problems with the time manipulation there.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.615
So the essence of the pattern is;

00:00:55.615 --> 00:00:59.975
check if the time has elapsed and next,

00:00:59.975 --> 00:01:04.159
increment the time, and this ensures that the function that is using

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:10.140
the modifier cannot be called if the interval has not yet elapsed.
