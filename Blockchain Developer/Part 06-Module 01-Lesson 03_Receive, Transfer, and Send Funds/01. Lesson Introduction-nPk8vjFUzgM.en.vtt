00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
Welcome to the blockchain nano degree course.

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.009
Our lesson topic is receive,

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.365
transfer, and send funds.

00:00:07.365 --> 00:00:11.009
We're going to divide this lesson up into four main sections.

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:13.859
In the first, we are going to review some of the Ether and

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:17.625
payment fundamentals that you've covered in previous courses.

00:00:17.625 --> 00:00:22.100
Next, we're going to take a look at the SafeMath library that ensures that

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.915
your smart contract code does math in a secure way.

00:00:26.914 --> 00:00:32.225
We'll follow that by an exploration of payment protection patterns.

00:00:32.225 --> 00:00:35.000
When you're smart contracts have payments,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.195
there are some established design patterns that you can use to

00:00:38.195 --> 00:00:42.335
ensure that you handle transactions in a secure manner.

00:00:42.335 --> 00:00:48.859
Finally, we will review 10 best practices for securing smart contracts.

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:53.359
The skills that we will cover in this lesson are,

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:56.795
first, the knowledge of Ether and payment fundamentals.

00:00:56.795 --> 00:01:00.140
Now, you've written code for this before in prior lessons,

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.829
but we're going to focus more on the security aspects of it.

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.390
You will also learn when it's appropriate to use

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.719
the SafeMath library for proper handling of math and prevent things like overflows.

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:18.260
You will learn the skills necessary for

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.135
protecting payments using three design patterns that we're going to cover.

00:01:23.135 --> 00:01:27.840
Finally, we are going to review a variety of attacks that are possible,

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.380
and how you can protect your smart contracts.
