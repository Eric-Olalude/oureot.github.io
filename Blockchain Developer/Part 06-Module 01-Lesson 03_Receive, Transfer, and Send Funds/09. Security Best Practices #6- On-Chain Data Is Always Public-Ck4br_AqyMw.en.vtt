00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.285
On-chain data is always public.

00:00:03.285 --> 00:00:05.985
Do not store any sensitive information.

00:00:05.985 --> 00:00:10.440
Keep in mind that if you have a scope of private that refers

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.805
to the scope of a variable within your Smart Contract.

00:00:14.805 --> 00:00:21.870
If someone has the wherewithal to read the Smart Contract in public when it's deployed,

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.190
they can still access any variables that are labeled private.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.420
Therefore, it is important to never store any sensitive information in

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.890
your Smart Contract variables unless it's completely encrypted.
