00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.705
Now that you've uploaded HTML files to IPFS,

00:00:03.705 --> 00:00:07.425
why not upload a full-blown website that you can share with others.

00:00:07.424 --> 00:00:11.189
The goal in this video is to help you get up and running with a template to

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:15.254
show you how you can use IPFS as a free web hosting service.

00:00:15.255 --> 00:00:17.940
To do that, we'll download a Bootstrap template

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.015
then add a few personal changes before publishing it.

00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:26.370
To get started, I'm going to go download a template from Start Bootstrap.com.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.530
If you're familiar with building websites,

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.960
feel free to use whichever files you would like.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.660
I'm just doing this to show you a super quick way to

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:37.139
get a website started with a decent amount of functionality.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.814
So first, navigate to Start Bootstrap.com

00:00:40.814 --> 00:00:44.614
and choose whatever template you like. I'll choose this one.

00:00:44.615 --> 00:00:50.070
I'll download it, add it to my desktop and unzip the file.

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:57.939
Next, go back to the terminal,

00:00:57.939 --> 00:01:02.314
change into the websites directory and open it in your code editor.

00:01:02.314 --> 00:01:07.980
We can navigate to the ReadMe to see instructions on how to get this up and running.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.260
Depending on which template you picked,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.000
your instructions may be different.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.594
But for me, I need to run a few commands.

00:01:16.594 --> 00:01:22.379
First, I'll run npm install to install all of the dependencies.

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:28.234
Next, since there were some warnings,

00:01:28.234 --> 00:01:32.245
I'll run npm audit fix to help address them.

00:01:32.245 --> 00:01:37.325
Finally, I'll run gulp dev to run this site on my local host.

00:01:37.325 --> 00:01:42.335
This is just to give me a chance to see it locally before I go and upload it to IPFS.

00:01:42.334 --> 00:01:45.484
Before publishing it, I'd like to customize a few things.

00:01:45.484 --> 00:01:48.355
For one, since this is my personal website,

00:01:48.355 --> 00:01:50.314
I should at least have my name on it.

00:01:50.314 --> 00:01:55.405
For that, I'll go into the HTML file and update the title to say my name.

00:01:55.405 --> 00:01:58.210
You can update the images HTML,

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:02.254
CSS or JavaScript to turn this into whatever site you'd like.

00:02:02.254 --> 00:02:05.929
Back at the terminal, a back out of this folder using cd

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.775
dot dot to add the entire directory to IPFS.

00:02:09.775 --> 00:02:14.210
Before doing this, I quickly wanted to mention that I'm trying to get this up quickly but

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.745
it's really not the best practice to put your entire website onto the hosting platform.

00:02:18.745 --> 00:02:22.430
Normally, what you're going to want do is put all of your assets that actually

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.585
need to be hosted into a single folder and then publish that folder.

00:02:26.585 --> 00:02:28.760
So, I just wanted to mention for now,

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:32.560
I'm doing this the wrong way but it so we can just get it up and running quickly.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.155
Okay. So let's do it.

00:02:34.155 --> 00:02:38.659
Type ipfs add -r my homepage.

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:43.625
This will upload every file for the website to IPFS and allow you to see it there.

00:02:43.625 --> 00:02:47.405
The last hash you'll see should be the directory for the site.

00:02:47.405 --> 00:02:49.640
After adding this the IPFS,

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:54.604
we can publish the directory using IPFS name like we did with the HTML file.

00:02:54.604 --> 00:02:58.804
So the last thing we need to do is type ipfs name publish,

00:02:58.805 --> 00:03:01.560
followed by the hash of the directory.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.375
This will publish our website.

00:03:05.375 --> 00:03:08.840
While this is publishing, there's one last thing I wanted to go over.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.360
Right now, these URLs are pretty ugly.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.780
This long hash value is impossible for anyone to remember.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.185
What if you already have your own website and you want to use that URL?

00:03:18.185 --> 00:03:19.930
Well, that's possible.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.240
Since you have your static URL from IPNS,

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.240
all you need to do is update the existing URL to point to this IPNS name.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.395
If you ever bought a domain name through providers like Namecheap or GoDaddy,

00:03:32.395 --> 00:03:36.145
you can easily change the records to use your existing URL.

00:03:36.145 --> 00:03:40.060
Another option would be to just use a URL shortener like Bitly.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.305
So, by putting the hash value I got into the gateway for IPFS,

00:03:44.305 --> 00:03:47.840
I can see the new website I just published.

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:57.489
And here it is. Title here is

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.050
John and I'm ready to get moving and turn this into my own personal profile.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.469
So, that's it for getting your own personal website published to IPFS.

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:08.495
Congratulations if you made it this far.

00:04:08.495 --> 00:04:11.030
I hope you're able to get your website up and running.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.030
This site could be a great way to show projects you've worked on as

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.745
a blockchain developer while even having the site itself be on a decentralized network.

00:04:18.745 --> 00:04:20.329
To me, that's pretty exciting.

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.399
I hope you've enjoyed getting this site up for yourself.
