00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.605
In the last few sections,

00:00:01.605 --> 00:00:04.004
you got introduced to a lot of new ideas.

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:08.955
This section is a little break from new concepts and should actually go pretty quick.

00:00:08.955 --> 00:00:11.564
We'll use all the same ideas you just learned,

00:00:11.564 --> 00:00:14.309
to apply them to all types of files like images,

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.250
PDFs, videos, and entire folders.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.640
I won't go over all the same things like updating files.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.050
It's really just to show you how these same ideas apply to all file types.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.394
I'm really hoping that the last sections covered the concepts well enough

00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:32.564
that you're able to apply them to these new file types. Let's get started.

00:00:32.564 --> 00:00:35.679
First, let's upload an image to IPFS.

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:39.130
I put an image in my directory called image.jpg.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.200
You can upload this using ipfsaddimage.jpg.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:50.480
To view this image, type ipfs cat followed by the hash value of this image.

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:53.899
Since you can't really see an image in the terminal what it

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:56.975
shows you instead is an encoded version of this image.

00:00:56.975 --> 00:00:58.399
To actually view it,

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.644
go back to the IPFS Gateway in your browser and include the image hash,

00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:04.630
you originally got back.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.569
Great, there it is.

00:01:06.569 --> 00:01:10.924
Just to show you, I also have a PDF and video in my directory.

00:01:10.924 --> 00:01:16.599
I'll type ipfsaddbook.pdf to add the PDF.

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:22.024
I'll also type IPFS add video.mp4 to add the video.

00:01:22.025 --> 00:01:26.300
Any of these files are now viewable through the Gateway using their hash value.

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.509
I'll check out the video just because I think it's really cool to see.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.799
Okay, we'll run through that pretty quick and it would be

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.560
great if you have some time to explore this for yourself.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.659
It's pretty simple once you get used to it,

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.269
but there's one more thing you might find interesting.

00:01:47.269 --> 00:01:49.969
Rather than uploading files one by one,

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:53.734
you can upload an entire directory using the -R flag.

00:01:53.734 --> 00:01:55.799
Similar to these other commands,

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.269
-R isn't specific to IPFS.

00:01:58.269 --> 00:02:00.890
It's a Linux command that will go through each file

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.784
and folder within the directory you specify.

00:02:03.784 --> 00:02:07.424
Along with the IPFS add command, this is saying,

00:02:07.424 --> 00:02:08.840
''Go through this folder,

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.310
every file and folder within the folder and add all of them to IPFS.''

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.759
So, let's try it. To start,

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:20.870
I'll back out of the folder I'm in using cd dot dot. Now, I'll add that

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.580
folder using ipfsadd-Ripfs.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.735
The second IPFS is just because that happens to be the name of the folder.

00:02:29.735 --> 00:02:32.480
What we get back is a value for each file

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:35.764
within the folder and a hash for the folder itself.

00:02:35.764 --> 00:02:37.849
Using this directory hash,

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.799
we can do a couple of new things.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.505
First, we can look at the contents of the folder at anytime using

00:02:43.504 --> 00:02:47.659
ipfs ls and then the hash value of the directory.

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:49.625
Great, there they are.

00:02:49.625 --> 00:02:54.775
We can also look up this folder and its files using the IPFS Gateway.

00:02:54.775 --> 00:02:57.500
To do that, go back to your web browser and

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.875
change the hash value to the one given for the folder.

00:03:00.875 --> 00:03:03.979
You can click on any of the files here to see them,

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:05.959
just the same as you did before.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.689
I'll click on the image to look at that,

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:11.509
back out and then click on the text to view that.

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:14.750
Pretty cool. One last thing,

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.389
it's been awhile since we looked at the web UI,

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:19.750
but at this point it's worth checking out.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.215
To see these files from the web UI,

00:03:22.215 --> 00:03:29.735
go back to localhost:5001/webui and select files from the left sidebar.

00:03:29.735 --> 00:03:32.870
There you'll see all the files you've been uploading and

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.310
can check them out using RAW or DAG like before.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.870
So, that wraps up the commands you'll need to know to work with any type of file in IPFS.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.689
At this point, you can upload pretty much anything.

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:47.555
In this video, we work specifically with images,

00:03:47.555 --> 00:03:50.344
videos, PDFs and directories.

00:03:50.344 --> 00:03:53.300
Feel free to experiment more with this for yourself.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.475
When you're ready, I'll see you in the next section,

00:03:55.474 --> 00:04:00.620
we will put our first code on the IPFS by building a basic website using HTML.
