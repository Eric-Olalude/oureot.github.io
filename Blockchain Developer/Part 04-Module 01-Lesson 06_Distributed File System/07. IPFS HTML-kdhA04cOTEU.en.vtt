00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.995
In the last video, we went over many of the different file types you can upload to IPFS.

00:00:04.995 --> 00:00:07.380
All these files can be shared with others using

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.975
the unique hash value found in the terminal window.

00:00:09.975 --> 00:00:14.325
One thing we haven't looked at yet is the ability to add code into IPFS.

00:00:14.325 --> 00:00:18.000
It's possible to work with files like HTML, JavaScript,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.870
CSS and any other type of program in IPFS.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.565
This code can be opened in the browser and is viewable in the same way as other files.

00:00:26.565 --> 00:00:31.185
But in this case, it's working like a web host rather than just simple file storage.

00:00:31.185 --> 00:00:34.245
In this video, we'll get started with a basic website

00:00:34.245 --> 00:00:37.230
using HTML that you can view in the browser.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.685
We'll create an HTML file and add it to IPFS.

00:00:40.685 --> 00:00:45.140
Since it's important that websites have a static URL that doesn't change over time,

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.060
we'll go over how you can create one using IPFS and something known as IPNS,

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.375
the Interplanetary Naming System.

00:00:52.375 --> 00:00:57.425
To get started, make a directory to hold the HTML file for your website.

00:00:57.425 --> 00:01:00.295
Next, change into this directory.

00:01:00.295 --> 00:01:02.885
Now, create an HTML file.

00:01:02.885 --> 00:01:07.790
I'll do that using touch my-website.html.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.505
Now, open this file in your code editor.

00:01:10.505 --> 00:01:16.070
I left some simple HTML code down below the video that you can paste into this file.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.925
As you can see, it's about as simple as it gets for HTML.

00:01:19.925 --> 00:01:22.810
I've got a title and it says 'Hello world'.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.990
Feel free to update this if you'd like before adding it to IPFS.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.730
Next, we'll go back to the terminal and add this website to IPFS.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.465
We'll do this a little differently than before.

00:01:34.465 --> 00:01:38.265
First, use ipfs add just like before.

00:01:38.265 --> 00:01:42.970
Next, we'll do another step that publishes this file to IPNS.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.650
The command is ipfs name publish.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.880
To run this command,

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.710
you type this followed by the hash of the file you just added.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.375
Before running this command,

00:01:53.375 --> 00:01:56.935
check it out in the Help menu for a better idea of what's going on.

00:01:56.935 --> 00:02:01.240
To do that, type ipfs name -- help.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.905
Feel free to read through this for some extra details about IPNS.

00:02:05.905 --> 00:02:10.360
Ipfs name publish allows you access to IPNS

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.645
which provides a single hash value that you can use to access your website.

00:02:14.645 --> 00:02:19.660
They do this using pointers within the hash values that are created within each file.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.195
It takes a second to run.

00:02:21.195 --> 00:02:22.725
So, first, let's run it.

00:02:22.725 --> 00:02:26.360
While it's working, I'll explain a little bit about what's going on here.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.515
Run this command by typing ipfs name publish followed by the name of your HTML file.

00:02:32.515 --> 00:02:34.320
To understand what's going on,

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.260
it's important to know a little more about what's

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.130
happening when the hash values are created by the network.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.660
An easy way to understand this is by thinking about how blockchains work.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.940
Even though each block has its own unique hash value,

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.725
it's not completely random.

00:02:48.725 --> 00:02:51.830
Each block also references the block before it.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.950
This allows us to know the order of blocks which allows us to

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.945
trace the entire chain back to the original block if we wanted to.

00:02:58.945 --> 00:03:01.080
The same thing is going on here.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.505
Every version of a file published with IPFS and

00:03:04.505 --> 00:03:08.050
IPNS references earlier versions of that file.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.045
That makes it possible to trace files back through

00:03:11.045 --> 00:03:14.810
all the versions that have ever been created just like blocks.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.840
Knowing that we can use IPNS to create

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.800
a static hash that references the most recent version of a file.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.685
As new versions are created,

00:03:23.685 --> 00:03:28.100
the pointer from IPNS updates to reference the new hash value.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.010
This makes it possible to have a website that we can

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.360
actually update while maintaining a URL.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.595
So, by now, your site has hopefully been published.

00:03:37.595 --> 00:03:40.430
You'll see that you've been given two hash values now.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.190
The first is the IPNS hash.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.455
This is the one that will remain the same.

00:03:45.455 --> 00:03:49.025
The second is the unique hash for that version of the file.

00:03:49.025 --> 00:03:53.120
You can still always look up this file by its hash but this one will only

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.700
ever reference the exact file it was uploaded, not future versions.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.645
You can go back to your HTML file,

00:04:00.645 --> 00:04:04.220
update it, and then publish it back to this first hash value.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.860
This will make it so that the most recent version is

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.380
still accessible through this hashes URL.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.450
So, that wraps up this section.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.860
As you can see, even though HTML can be treated as just another file,

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.630
I used the opportunity to show you how IPNS helps improve the management of these files.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.470
This same publishing technique works for any file you might want to work with.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.390
You can go back and use it for text,

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.030
images, videos or whatever you'd like.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.000
Coming up, we'll use this same idea to get you set up with

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.410
your own personal profile page hosted on IPFS.
