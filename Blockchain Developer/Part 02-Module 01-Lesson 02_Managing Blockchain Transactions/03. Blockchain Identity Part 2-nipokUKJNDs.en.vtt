00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.410
We'll need to make it so that our transactions can't be traced either.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.445
That's done by creating a wallet address.

00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:12.085
Our wallet address is made from the public key in

00:00:12.085 --> 00:00:15.850
a similar way to how the public key was made from the private key.

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:17.359
It's a similar issue,

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:19.439
so we handle it in a similar way.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:25.220
This time we run our public key through an algorithm to create the wallet address.

00:00:25.219 --> 00:00:28.140
Like before, this algorithm makes it possible to

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.064
find the wallet address from the public key, but not the opposite.

00:00:32.064 --> 00:00:35.809
Bitcoin uses two different algorithms to make this happen.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.150
These algorithms are the secure hash algorithm or

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:46.799
SHA-256 and the primitive to digest, or RIPEMD-160.

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:49.079
The numbers at the end stand for

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.104
the length of the output that's created by the algorithm.

00:00:52.104 --> 00:01:00.974
256 means the output is 256 bits and 160 means that the output is 160 bits.

00:01:00.975 --> 00:01:03.380
Here's what that process looks like.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.375
We start with the public key.

00:01:05.375 --> 00:01:09.890
From there, we run it through the SHA-256 hashing function.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.885
That gives us a unique 256-bit number.

00:01:13.885 --> 00:01:22.535
Next, we take that 256-bit number and run it through the RIPEMD-160 hashing function.

00:01:22.534 --> 00:01:28.310
This turns that 256-bit number into a new unique 160-bit number.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.865
This number is our wallet address.

00:01:30.864 --> 00:01:32.500
We can share this unique,

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.409
secure wallet address without worrying about anyone

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.134
tracing that back to us or our secure wallet information.

00:01:39.135 --> 00:01:41.890
At this point, the heavy lifting is done.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.980
But we do put this final address through one more step.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.049
This step isn't for security.

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.674
It's used to make an address that's a little easier for us to read.

00:01:52.674 --> 00:01:55.715
This allows us to share it with others more easily.

00:01:55.715 --> 00:02:00.344
Right now we're stuck with a huge ugly number that no one wants to look at.

00:02:00.344 --> 00:02:02.405
To make something readable,

00:02:02.405 --> 00:02:05.295
we want it to be a much shorter number.

00:02:05.295 --> 00:02:07.450
To take it one step further.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.870
Let's even take out numbers and letters that look

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.110
similar so we don't mix things up while reading them.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.650
That means and a smaller string without zeros,

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.545
O's or other combinations of letters and numbers that look the same.

00:02:20.544 --> 00:02:24.399
To do this, we take the 160-bit number that we got from

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.645
the RIPEMD-160 and put it through something known as a Base58Check.

00:02:30.645 --> 00:02:35.145
The Base58Check takes that huge ugly number we didn't like

00:02:35.145 --> 00:02:39.969
and turns it into a much smaller ugly number that we can share with anyone.

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:44.300
Okay. Now, we finally have our shareable wallet address.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.975
That was a lot of information, so let's review.

00:02:47.974 --> 00:02:51.000
Our goal was to create a wallet that provides

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.914
security while allowing us to make transactions.

00:02:53.914 --> 00:02:56.530
To do this, we started with a private key,

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.715
which we want no one to see and pass it through an algorithm to create our public key.

00:03:01.715 --> 00:03:06.580
This public key then went through some more algorithms to create our wallet address.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.505
As you can see, this already is getting a bit complicated.

00:03:10.504 --> 00:03:15.449
The benefit here is that many of these steps are programmed and happen automatically.

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:17.405
This allows everything to happen almost

00:03:17.405 --> 00:03:21.560
instantaneously when compared to the banking system.
