00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.295
So far, we introduced three types of wallets: non-deterministic wallets,

00:00:05.295 --> 00:00:10.070
sequential deterministic wallets, and hierarchical deterministic wallets.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.500
Now, that we understand hashing and private keys better,

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.900
let's return to these wallets and discuss how

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.760
they're generated and when to use each type.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.545
First, let's focus on non-deterministic wallets.

00:00:22.545 --> 00:00:28.155
Non-deterministic wallets were created during the first implementation of Bitcoin client.

00:00:28.155 --> 00:00:30.130
These are random wallets,

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.230
which means that the keys are generated randomly,

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.770
and there's no way to determine how they were derived?

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.520
Non-deterministic wallets can be thought of as a collection of

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.840
randomly generated private keys that have no association with each other.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.860
In short, a random number generate a private key,

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.975
which is used to generate a public key,

00:00:50.975 --> 00:00:53.490
which gives us the wallet address.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:59.060
For privacy, it's best practice to generate new wallet addresses for each transaction.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.085
So, no one can track links between the addresses.

00:01:02.085 --> 00:01:03.825
Now, based on this logic,

00:01:03.825 --> 00:01:06.145
every time a new key is generated,

00:01:06.145 --> 00:01:07.790
you need to backup the wallet,

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.235
so as not to lose the newly generated private key,

00:01:10.235 --> 00:01:12.330
and this seems like quite a chore.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.425
So, why even bother with non-deterministic wallets.

00:01:15.425 --> 00:01:20.370
Well, there are situations where wallets might be generated for backend services,

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.695
using private keys that are not derived from a seed.

00:01:23.695 --> 00:01:30.570
The opposite of non-deterministic wallets aka random wallets are deterministic wallets.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.205
In a deterministic wallet, all addresses,

00:01:34.205 --> 00:01:38.715
private keys, and public keys can be traced back to the original seed.

00:01:38.715 --> 00:01:43.290
So, there's a purpose behind each of these IDs and nothing is random,

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.065
because they can be determined.

00:01:45.065 --> 00:01:48.280
So, deterministic, determined get it?
