00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.785
At this point, you should have a pretty solid idea of what supply chain management is.

00:00:04.785 --> 00:00:09.164
With that in mind, we can start to look at how smart contracts can help improve them.

00:00:09.164 --> 00:00:11.729
In this video, we'll look at three key ways that

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.400
a smart contract can improve supply chain management.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.894
Transparency, traceability and efficiency.

00:00:17.894 --> 00:00:21.750
First, the block chains open and shared information allows

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.210
both businesses and consumers to better track

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.225
and monitor information about their goods and services.

00:00:27.225 --> 00:00:31.740
For example, a term known as 'Farm to Table' describes the ability for

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:34.170
smart contracts solutions to track the quality

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.125
of food and reliability of those who handled it.

00:00:37.125 --> 00:00:40.784
We can use the blockchain to collect data from the time it has grown

00:00:40.784 --> 00:00:44.549
through the supply chain and up until the time it reaches your home.

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:47.149
This gives you the ability to ensure that the food

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.284
you eat is safe and coming from reliable sources.

00:00:50.284 --> 00:00:52.939
This same idea can be applied to goods,

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:56.089
services, credentials and digital products.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.220
This transparency allows you to have

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:01.504
more confidence in the legitimacy of the good you purchase.

00:01:01.505 --> 00:01:05.210
This transparency forces companies to make decisions that favor

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:07.579
the consumer rather than cutting costs and

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:10.534
places that might negatively affect the products they sell.

00:01:10.534 --> 00:01:13.939
In a way, this helps level the playing field for suppliers that

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:17.269
are putting in the time and energy to ensure a quality product.

00:01:17.269 --> 00:01:18.859
On top of transparency,

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:23.140
smart contracts can improve the traceability of products in the supply chain.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.814
Using smart contracts, you can choose any number of steps that you'd like to track,

00:01:27.814 --> 00:01:30.230
program contracts for them and then get

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.100
accurate information about the product as it travels through the supply chain.

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:37.640
This can also be done by including smart sensors connected to

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.590
these contracts that can give you lots of

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.174
interesting data about the product quality and its journey.

00:01:43.174 --> 00:01:45.640
For example, if you order meat,

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.310
a smart sensor could check how long it was in a truck during shipment,

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.460
whether it was stored at the correct temperature or if

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:55.779
it's coming from areas with known problems with their meat at the time.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.015
This unique ability to trace the origin of each product

00:01:59.015 --> 00:02:02.840
becomes a valuable tool in cases where a recall is needed.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.715
As a quick note, the original point of origin is known as provenance.

00:02:07.715 --> 00:02:11.479
You'll probably start hearing provenance come up pretty often in this space.

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:15.724
Finally, supply chain management is focused on efficiency.

00:02:15.724 --> 00:02:17.599
By programming smart contracts,

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:22.299
we can help answer questions like how fast the process is or how much it costs.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.260
Smart contracts can be written to help automate some types of negotiations that can

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:29.689
handle the back-and-forth that companies may normally go

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:32.734
through when working with their contractual obligations.

00:02:32.735 --> 00:02:36.080
They also give companies access to a shared database that

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.860
they can use to help verify the accuracy of their records.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.990
This helps save time,

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.540
cuts costs and accelerates the creation and

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:47.704
delivery of goods and services by the companies involved.

00:02:47.705 --> 00:02:49.850
That wraps up a quick overview of

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.484
how smart contracts can be used to help improve supply chain management.

00:02:53.485 --> 00:02:58.160
It's a way to automate trust between companies suppliers and customers and opens up

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:00.229
a whole new range of possibilities for making

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:03.599
a more efficient and cost-effective business solution.
