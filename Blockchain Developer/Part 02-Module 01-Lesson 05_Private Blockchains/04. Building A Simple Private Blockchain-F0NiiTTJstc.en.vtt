00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.990
In a previous lesson,

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:06.470
you learned to discover a blocks content using Bitcoin Core.

00:00:06.469 --> 00:00:11.125
We navigated down the path of what a blockchain block looks like.

00:00:11.125 --> 00:00:15.995
Each block contains a header describing the core information about the block.

00:00:15.994 --> 00:00:20.585
Next, we have the body of the block which contains the data.

00:00:20.585 --> 00:00:26.800
Each block chain platform has a data model which is restricted by the platform protocol.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.810
We are now going to navigate down the path of creating

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:34.009
our own simple blockchain which will allow us to navigate creatively,

00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:37.019
past transactional information within the block's body.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.765
We will have the ability to control our own data model.

00:00:40.765 --> 00:00:45.420
The important thing is that the blocks are chained together using hashes.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.480
Let's start with the creation of our blockchain block data model.
