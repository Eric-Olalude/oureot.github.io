00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
Public blockchains can serve as a backbone for

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.685
nearly any democratized solution whether verifying identity,

00:00:07.684 --> 00:00:13.394
helping Internet users gain control over their data or enhancing collaborative efforts.

00:00:13.394 --> 00:00:17.475
Public blockchains are at the front line of the revolution because

00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:21.845
of their permissionless design that allows anyone to participate.

00:00:21.844 --> 00:00:24.750
In course one, you learned the value of

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.629
identity management with your private and public keys and wallet addresses.

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:33.799
With course two, you were introduced to the public testnet.

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:36.949
This is a great example of a public blockchain.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.965
All of us are able to participate without needing permission.

00:00:40.965 --> 00:00:44.465
It's pretty clear the power of a public blockchain,

00:00:44.465 --> 00:00:48.165
but what does it mean to be a private blockchain?

00:00:48.164 --> 00:00:50.210
In this video, we will discuss

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.620
the essential difference between public and private blockchains.

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:58.054
We'll compare them based on four atributtes; their permissions,

00:00:58.054 --> 00:01:04.094
scalability, vulnerability and compliance. Let's get started.

00:01:04.094 --> 00:01:09.390
First, let's look at how permissions differ between these blockchain types.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.545
Public blockchains are open and permissionless allowing

00:01:12.545 --> 00:01:15.850
anyone to participate or benefit from the technology.

00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:21.599
For example, bitcoin is known for its creation of a blockchain with public protocol.

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:23.949
This allows for users to build and run

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.810
their own peer-to-peer transaction network without building their own ecosystem.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.564
Anyone can participate.

00:01:30.564 --> 00:01:34.034
This is the driving force behind public blockchains.

00:01:34.034 --> 00:01:39.039
The success of bitcoins public protocol led to create a new platform,

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.615
which foster an open ecosystem with a public protocol.

00:01:43.614 --> 00:01:47.000
One of these platforms has become very popular,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.555
is known as Ethereum.

00:01:48.555 --> 00:01:50.890
This is known as the second generation of

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.004
blockchain services and you'll be learning more about this later on in our program.

00:01:56.004 --> 00:01:59.349
Unlike public blockchains, private blockchains require

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:03.784
permission to access and typically operate under centralized control.

00:02:03.784 --> 00:02:09.305
Let's look a little more into private blockchains starting with scalability.

00:02:09.305 --> 00:02:12.710
Private block chains benefit from efficiency in terms

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.250
of scalability and compliance with regulatory requirements.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.509
The drawback with a private permission blockchain is the vulnerability of its network,

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:24.560
where bad actors could potentially manipulate its dataset

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.055
due to vulnerabilities of centralized governance.

00:02:28.055 --> 00:02:30.920
While private blockchains have low transparency,

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:34.899
meaning they restrict information from being seen by the general public,

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.640
they also rely on their limited private networks

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.659
to maintain the integrity of the blockchain itself.

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:44.349
Public blockchains on the other hand are permissionless and can

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.849
be maintained by anyone with sufficient computing power to do so.

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:53.784
The public openness allows for full transparency of the information they contain.

00:02:53.784 --> 00:03:00.109
The biggest drawback of public blockchain is scalability and regulatory compliance.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.560
For instance, with Bitcoin Core,

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.349
transactions on the public chain are

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:10.454
time-restricted with new blocks being added to the chain about every 10 minutes.

00:03:10.455 --> 00:03:14.980
This restriction improves security and controls supply yet impacts

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:20.689
scalability of transactions the platform can process at any given time.

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:23.120
As far as regulatory compliance,

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.395
a public blockchain lacks centralized control.

00:03:26.395 --> 00:03:28.689
When new laws are created by

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:33.590
local governments there is limited ability to adopt those laws.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.069
To recap, we just compared the difference between private and public blockchains,

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.644
a quick overview of permission types,

00:03:41.645 --> 00:03:45.655
Scalability, Vulnerability and Compliance.

00:03:45.655 --> 00:03:48.250
For more details, it's best to review

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.794
developer documentation for the platform you're interested in.

00:03:51.794 --> 00:03:55.239
Understanding the difference will help you know when it's best to

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:00.159
apply a public or private blockchain depending on your use case.
