00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
Now that we have the basic behavior scoped out in our activity diagram.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.405
Let's discuss the Sequence Diagram.

00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:09.495
A sequence diagram depicts the interaction between

00:00:09.494 --> 00:00:13.289
objects in the order or the sequence in which the interactions take place,

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:15.224
hence the name Sequence Diagram.

00:00:15.224 --> 00:00:18.644
The boxes at the top represent the object names.

00:00:18.644 --> 00:00:21.225
These objects that are involved in the system.

00:00:21.225 --> 00:00:24.075
These objects are instances of classes.

00:00:24.074 --> 00:00:28.274
The dashed lines hanging from the boxes are called object lifelines.

00:00:28.274 --> 00:00:32.280
They represent the lifespan of the object doing scenario being modeled.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.439
To show an object interacting via

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:38.519
a method call you draw a horizontal line from one lifeline to another.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.670
The method name is placed above this arrow line.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.664
The long thin boxes on the lifeline are activation boxes which

00:00:45.664 --> 00:00:49.984
indicate when the actor or the object is active and processing the methods.

00:00:49.984 --> 00:00:53.990
In this case, the breeder carries out the race pet method,

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.710
vaccinate pet method and the advertiser adoption method,

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.719
which involves the pet object.

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:02.929
The breeder then invokes the meal adopter method.

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:06.709
if all goes well the owner adopts the pet and the pet

00:01:06.709 --> 00:01:11.119
will end up in the new owners home after it makes the fetch pet paw to the owner.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.359
Before we continue to illustrate diagrams,

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:16.310
I'd like you to take some time to use your supply chain example

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.909
from the activity diagram section and design a sequence diagram for it.
