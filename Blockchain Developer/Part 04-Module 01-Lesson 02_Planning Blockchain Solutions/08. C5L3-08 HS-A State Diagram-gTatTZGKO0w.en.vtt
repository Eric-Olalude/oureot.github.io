00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.599
With the activity and sequence interaction scoped out,

00:00:03.599 --> 00:00:07.380
let's discuss the states which will determine the state of the acid.

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.289
A state diagram, is a type of behavioral diagram,

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:14.399
that shows how an object moves through various states within its lifetime.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.230
Now, different from the activity or

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.964
sequence diagrams that we saw earlier, a state diagram,

00:00:18.964 --> 00:00:21.144
shows the actual changes in the state,

00:00:21.144 --> 00:00:24.480
not just the process or commands that created those changes.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.730
When drawing a state machine diagram,

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.120
the thing that you want to do is identify the creation state,

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.370
and whether any final states exist.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.929
After you've done this, consider

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:37.049
what other stages in the life of an object it passes through.

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:38.759
In our pet shop example,

00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:41.795
the object whose state that we're most interested in is the pet,

00:00:41.795 --> 00:00:44.405
the creation state begins with it being raised,

00:00:44.405 --> 00:00:46.495
and completes it once it's adopted.

00:00:46.494 --> 00:00:51.140
Using the behaviors and methods that we determined in our activity and sequence diagrams,

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.350
we can create the states for the breeder and the owner as well.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.745
Now we just saw how to diagram the behaviors for a very simple supply chain.

00:00:58.744 --> 00:01:01.849
The last diagram we'll discuss is our class diagram,

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.659
using what we've modeled with our behavioral diagrams.
