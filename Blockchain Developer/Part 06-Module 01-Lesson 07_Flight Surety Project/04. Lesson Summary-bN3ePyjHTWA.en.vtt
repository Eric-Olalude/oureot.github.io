00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.375
Let's review the lesson skills.

00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:07.365
So you've learned how to develop Dapps with great user experiences.

00:00:07.365 --> 00:00:11.054
We went through 10 specific aspects of developing

00:00:11.054 --> 00:00:16.320
user experiences that are important in the context of Dapps and blockchains.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.009
We also learned how to develop blockchain,

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:23.050
Dapp, and server code using modern techniques.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.699
We just went through the whole Visual Studio code for that.

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.089
It's a great boilerplate for you to use for future apps

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:33.810
but right now your focus needs to be on the project and

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.350
make sure that you can take advantage of all the code that's in there to really

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.585
create a great Flight Surety application.

00:00:41.585 --> 00:00:48.240
Finally, we also reviewed the requirements for the Flight Surety Project.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.025
We'll be communicating those in detail also.

00:00:52.024 --> 00:00:56.344
That wraps up the course lessons.

00:00:56.344 --> 00:00:59.939
Thank you for learning with us.
