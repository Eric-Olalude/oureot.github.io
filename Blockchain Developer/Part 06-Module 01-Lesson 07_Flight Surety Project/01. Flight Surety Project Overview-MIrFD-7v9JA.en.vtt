00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
Let's continue and review the requirements for the flight surety project.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.669
So the project in

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:16.410
a nutshell is flight delay insurance for passengers,

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.160
and you can imagine that a project of this nature is going

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.850
to be very complex and has lots of moving parts.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.205
So one of the things we've done is distill it down to the basics.

00:00:29.204 --> 00:00:34.604
So you can focus on the things that matter and develop your skills in those areas.

00:00:34.604 --> 00:00:40.125
So there are some areas where we'll have information that is simulated.

00:00:40.125 --> 00:00:44.744
There's some areas where you don't need to write code,

00:00:44.744 --> 00:00:46.684
that code is being provided to you.

00:00:46.685 --> 00:00:50.900
So you can focus all your attention on the part that matters,

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:56.699
and that's specifically is the idea of managing this program,

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.770
the flight surety program, as a collaboration between multiple airlines,

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.655
giving passengers the ability to purchase insurance prior to a flight,

00:01:06.655 --> 00:01:10.805
and then if the flight is delayed due to airline fault,

00:01:10.805 --> 00:01:15.515
passengers are paid 1.5 times the amount they paid for the insurance.

00:01:15.515 --> 00:01:17.090
Now this point in particular,

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.885
I just want to emphasize the 1.5x is an arbitrary number.

00:01:20.885 --> 00:01:25.689
In the real world, you would probably have very complex formulas, etc.,

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:31.250
that go into figuring out what the payout might be if such a thing happened.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.109
But for the sake of simplicity,

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:38.599
we'll focus on the interactions between the passenger and the contract,

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:41.254
etc., and not worry too much about the number.

00:01:41.254 --> 00:01:47.929
Finally, we will pick up on the skills we talked about in the prior lesson around

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:55.470
oracles and use that as a mechanism to deliver status information into the contract.
