00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.209
One last thing regarding the Smart Contracts and truffle is deploy contracts.

00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:07.679
So at some point,

00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:12.794
you will not want to use the test and you will want to deploy the code,

00:00:12.794 --> 00:00:16.964
so that the addresses of the contracts don't keep changing on you.

00:00:16.964 --> 00:00:19.559
Every time you run the truffle test,

00:00:19.559 --> 00:00:21.329
all the addresses are going to change,

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:23.114
and so it makes testing very hard.

00:00:23.114 --> 00:00:25.469
So the deployment script that's here,

00:00:25.469 --> 00:00:29.144
is doing a bit of work to make your life easier.

00:00:29.144 --> 00:00:33.734
First of all, it's going to deploy the contracts,

00:00:33.734 --> 00:00:35.325
but these two lines,

00:00:35.325 --> 00:00:37.095
there kind of helper lines,

00:00:37.094 --> 00:00:43.140
you may not necessarily need them because there's other ways to do it,

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.609
but they're here because it ensures that

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:50.780
every time you migrate your contracts to the blockchain,

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:58.100
the client dapp and the server dapp have the current addresses of the contracts.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.195
So what this is doing is generating a config.json file which I'll go into now.

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:07.295
You can see here, that it's giving you the URL,

00:01:07.295 --> 00:01:09.320
it's giving you the data address,

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:13.339
and the app address for the two contracts as they are deployed.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.560
So you'll find this to be a useful addition once your post using truffle testing and

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.019
need to get into the client and server development.

00:01:24.019 --> 00:01:26.375
So the way to trigger that,

00:01:26.375 --> 00:01:33.150
is to do truffle migrate.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.080
You may be already familiar with this,

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:40.340
but it's helpful to see a truffle 5.0 if you haven't done it with 5.0,

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.770
it gives a really good output here.

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:50.594
So what it did is essentially tell us that our contracts are deployed,

00:01:50.594 --> 00:01:53.329
and in doing that,

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:54.679
it created this file.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.035
In fact, let me just do that. I'll go ahead and delete this file and also delete

00:02:00.034 --> 00:02:06.224
the one in the server folder to make sure that that code is working as designed.

00:02:06.224 --> 00:02:08.500
So if I migrate again,

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.020
we should see those files being generated with

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:19.590
the correct addresses, and it worked.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.710
So we've got the latest,

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.599
greatest address right in there.

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.479
So that's a good segue way to our dapp.
