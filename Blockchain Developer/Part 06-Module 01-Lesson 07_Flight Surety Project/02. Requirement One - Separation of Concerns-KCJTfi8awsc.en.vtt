00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.325
Now, we'll move on to reviewing the requirements in detail.

00:00:05.325 --> 00:00:09.030
The first requirement is separation of concerns.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.580
So as I reviewed in the architecture slide,

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.640
we will have four components.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.295
We'll have the FlightSuretyData contract,

00:00:17.295 --> 00:00:20.700
that's the name of the actual contract for data persistence.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.535
We'll have the FlightSuretyApp contract for app logic and oracles code.

00:00:26.535 --> 00:00:30.230
We'll have the Dapp client for triggering the contract

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.490
calls so that trigger might occur based on user input.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.850
For example, a passenger decides to buy insurance

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.690
for a flight and that would trigger all the different contract calls.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:48.600
Then we have a server app for simulating the behavior and responses of the oracles.
