00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
Congratulations on getting through this lesson on Blockchain privacy.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.080
Throughout this lesson, you learned techniques you can use to

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.259
protect and enhance the privacy of blockchain applications.

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:14.189
You learnt several new concepts like hashing, Merkle trees,

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:16.620
ring signatures, zero-knowledge proofs,

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.035
ZK snacks, and differential privacy.

00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:20.879
These are advanced techniques.

00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:22.230
So, if you've understood them,

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.344
congratulations you're doing great work.

00:00:24.344 --> 00:00:27.869
If some of the details are still a bit fuzzy, that's okay.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.660
This is the type of thing that becomes clear with practice.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.810
Start working with the code examples in a research link provided.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.020
At this point, you should feel like you have

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.710
a strong conceptual understanding of Blockchain privacy techniques.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.895
Start to think about how to implement them yourself within your blockchain applications.

00:00:43.895 --> 00:00:47.810
Privacy is an absolutely necessary requirement in many applications.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:53.255
So, there's huge demand for developers who understand these complex and important ideas.

00:00:53.255 --> 00:00:56.795
I'm excited to have had the opportunity to teach you these new skills,

00:00:56.795 --> 00:01:01.100
and I hope you find them useful as you continue your journey as a blockchain developer.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.170
One final important note,

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.215
years and years of research has gone into privacy, cryptography,

00:01:06.215 --> 00:01:08.900
and blockchains, and all of this research has been shared

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.080
with the community freely and openly for the benefit of everyone.

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:16.079
These problems are much bigger than any one person or company could ever solve,

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:21.185
and we've grown a completely open and innovative community around all this knowledge.

00:01:21.185 --> 00:01:26.045
So, as you continue your education and begin to make discoveries of your own,

00:01:26.045 --> 00:01:28.625
please remember to give back your ideas

00:01:28.625 --> 00:01:31.930
as freely and generously as they were shared with you.
