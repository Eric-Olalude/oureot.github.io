00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.705
By now, you must be eager to get some hands-on experience with the Ethereum tooling,

00:00:05.705 --> 00:00:08.890
various client types, different networks, wallet,

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.409
and how to set up a death sandbox for your projects.

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:14.025
So, in this section,

00:00:14.025 --> 00:00:17.500
we'll learn how to download and setup in Ethereum Command Line Interface.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.140
The specific client app,

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.420
we shall focus on is called go-ethereum.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.160
So, but before we do that,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.350
it's important to know what other client types available,

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.335
but just in case you need it for future reference.

00:00:30.335 --> 00:00:31.560
So, as you can see,

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:36.710
multiple client implementations across different operating systems exist.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.189
The list of languages is Go, Rust,

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:45.045
C++, Python, JavaScript, Java, Ruby, and Haskell.

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:49.770
So, shortly we'll work through the Go Implementation.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.984
The go-ethereum client is also referred as Geth.

00:00:53.984 --> 00:00:59.159
This is go-implementation to run a command line interface often ethereum node.

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:00.464
By running this node,

00:01:00.465 --> 00:01:02.885
you have the option to participate in

00:01:02.884 --> 00:01:06.194
any of the live networks including the main and the test.

00:01:06.194 --> 00:01:08.899
Some of the functions are you can create accounts,

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.149
transfer funds between ethereum addresses,

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:12.534
you can create contracts,

00:01:12.534 --> 00:01:15.640
send transactions, explore blockchain history.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.180
Now, you can follow the instructions on this page and install

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.670
the latest version of Geth on your respective machines and operating systems of a dash,

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.799
the link to this page in the resources section for you.

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:36.329
For example here, we will be installing Geth using Homebrew on a Mac.

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.170
The command you want to run, it's right there.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.454
So, you can say, brew tap ethereum/ethereum,

00:01:43.454 --> 00:01:46.640
brew install ethereum, or if you've already installed it,

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.390
you can use brew upgrade ethereum.

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:55.104
So, just go to the installation steps, it'll say,

00:01:55.105 --> 00:01:57.555
so now the installation is done,

00:01:57.555 --> 00:02:03.914
let's run the Geth Client and sync up to one of the tests networks.

00:02:03.914 --> 00:02:08.455
Later on, we'll cover the various ethereum networks and sync modes.

00:02:08.455 --> 00:02:11.975
So, we'll be syncing to the Rinkeby test network.

00:02:11.974 --> 00:02:14.819
The command you want to run is Geth.

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.019
I'll give you the command lines in a minute.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.750
So, it's geth --rinkeby -syncmode

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.139
"fast" and I've attached the link to this page in the bottom.

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:28.029
So, the command like I said,

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.650
it's brew install ethereum or brew upgrade.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.305
I've already got ethereum installed, so I won't do that.

00:02:34.305 --> 00:02:44.335
So, the command you would run as geth --rinkeby --syncmode so within double-quotes fast.

00:02:44.335 --> 00:02:46.080
So, when you run that,

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.719
you will have something like this running.

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:52.194
So, this is basically what they'll run a process.

00:02:52.194 --> 00:02:55.120
So, once get this running on your machine or it's

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.855
syncing with the rest of the Ethereum network,

00:02:58.854 --> 00:03:03.699
every 15 seconds or so you will see a new block being imported.

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:05.299
So, for every row,

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.180
you'll notice that the following fields are shown like you'll

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.084
have something call the blocks, the info,

00:03:13.084 --> 00:03:17.655
the blocks that transactions message gas,

00:03:17.655 --> 00:03:21.520
elapsed time, message gas,

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.939
number hash and cash.

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:28.280
So that's typically what I wanted to cover in this lesson.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.960
So, having gone over some berries Client Types and witnessing how to download, install,

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.360
and run Geth on Ethereum as a command line interface,

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.299
it's your turn to just give it a go and let us know if you run into any problems,

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:47.284
just reach out to us in the community channel.

00:03:47.284 --> 00:03:52.799
In the next section, I'll cover ethereum graphical user interface.
