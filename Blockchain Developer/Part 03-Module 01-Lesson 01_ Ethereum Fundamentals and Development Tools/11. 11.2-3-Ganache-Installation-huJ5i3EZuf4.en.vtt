00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.019
When getting started with Ganache, you have two options.

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:06.689
You can use the Ganache user interface as shown here,

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.690
or the Ganache command line interface as shown here.

00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:11.419
Both of these do the same thing,

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:14.099
and it's up to you to choose which one you like best.

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.024
Here, I'll show you a little bit about what to expect when you're first getting started.

00:00:18.024 --> 00:00:21.384
First, to download the Ganache graphic user interface,

00:00:21.385 --> 00:00:22.980
you can go to their main site.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.429
It gives the option to install for a multiple operating systems.

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:29.730
You can click Download to get started with the installation process,

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.689
and once you've got it, you can open up the app to run your local blockchain.

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:36.134
Next, the Ganache CLI.

00:00:36.134 --> 00:00:40.504
You can install the Ganache CLI using npm as shown on their GitHub page.

00:00:40.505 --> 00:00:47.240
Go to your terminal and type npm install ganache-cli-g to begin the installation.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.250
After it's installed, you can run

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.079
ganache-cli from your terminal to create your local blockchain.

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.299
This is something you'll keep running in a separate terminal window that logs

00:00:56.299 --> 00:01:00.244
the information about the blockchain for you as you start making transactions.

00:01:00.244 --> 00:01:02.629
I'll go back to the Ganache graphic interface

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.915
to give a quick overview of what this tool does.

00:01:04.915 --> 00:01:07.490
Ganache provides you with 10 free accounts all

00:01:07.489 --> 00:01:11.104
preloaded with a 100 Ether each for you to make transactions with.

00:01:11.105 --> 00:01:12.590
For each of these accounts,

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.355
you'll see a transaction count and index and a key.

00:01:15.355 --> 00:01:18.020
If you ever need the private key of an account, like you will,

00:01:18.019 --> 00:01:19.924
to make transactions from your applications,

00:01:19.924 --> 00:01:21.789
you can click here to view it.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.480
You can use this mnemonic here as a seed phrase to connect your other tools to.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.160
For example, in MetaMask,

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.709
if you restore an account with a seed phrase and use this,

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:33.804
you've just connected MetaMask to your local blockchain.

00:01:33.805 --> 00:01:35.610
In this small bar here,

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:36.825
you can see the Current Block,

00:01:36.825 --> 00:01:38.115
the Gas Price and Limit,

00:01:38.114 --> 00:01:40.334
the Network ID, the RPC Server,

00:01:40.334 --> 00:01:41.739
and the Mining Status.

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:43.670
Each time you make a new transaction,

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.754
you'll see this current block number go up.

00:01:45.754 --> 00:01:48.935
Another important thing to note here is the RPC server.

00:01:48.935 --> 00:01:52.129
If you ever want to connect to this blockchain from something like Remix,

00:01:52.129 --> 00:01:56.060
you'll use this server as the connection URL. We'll be doing that later on.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.460
Across the top, you'll see Accounts,

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:00.640
Blocks, Transactions, and Logs.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.840
The Accounts tab is what we're on now.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.150
Under Blocks, you'll see each of the blocks that

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.385
are created as you begin making transactions.

00:02:07.385 --> 00:02:11.525
You can click on this for more details like the time it was mined and the blockhash.

00:02:11.525 --> 00:02:15.670
Transactions is another view similar to the blocks but for each of the transactions.

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:17.159
As transactions come up,

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.289
you can click on them for more information.

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:21.650
Finally, there's the logs over here.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.780
These logs are the data being registered on

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.814
the blockchain before being shown to you in the UI they provide.

00:02:26.814 --> 00:02:29.210
On the top right, there's a search bar that allows you to

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.510
search by block or transaction hashes,

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:33.969
similar to Etherscan but for your own blockchain.

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:36.014
There's also a sneaky button here,

00:02:36.014 --> 00:02:37.539
it actually took me awhile to notice.

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:39.459
You probably won't need to use this at first,

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.950
but it's good to know about in case you want to customize something.

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:44.655
Here, you can change the details about your blockchain.

00:02:44.655 --> 00:02:48.544
Under Server, you can change things like the port number and network ID.

00:02:48.544 --> 00:02:49.864
In Accounts and Keys,

00:02:49.865 --> 00:02:53.094
you can change the number of accounts and Ether that each account has.

00:02:53.094 --> 00:02:55.435
You can also change the mnemonic if you want.

00:02:55.435 --> 00:02:57.469
The rest is all stuff you can check out,

00:02:57.469 --> 00:02:59.555
but we won't be looking at it much in this lesson.

00:02:59.555 --> 00:03:02.245
So that's a look at everything on the graphic interface.

00:03:02.245 --> 00:03:04.150
Over on the CLI, it's basically

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.030
the same thing but without all the support of the user interface.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.754
I'll be switching back and forth sometimes,

00:03:08.754 --> 00:03:11.139
but I'll mostly be using the graphic interface anytime I

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:14.494
want to point something out specific that's happening on the blockchain.

00:03:14.495 --> 00:03:17.060
If you're an advocate of CLI tools,

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.805
try figuring out what you'd like to view using the user interface,

00:03:19.805 --> 00:03:22.925
then go to the Docs and find the command they provide to do that.

00:03:22.925 --> 00:03:24.980
From there, you'll be set up to view anything you

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:27.560
like about your local blockchain from the terminal.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.479
We'll be using these a lot coming up,

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:30.829
and you'll always be able to use these for

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.660
testing your DApps in the future if you'd like.
