00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.214
Accounts are a fundamental component of the Ethereum platform.

00:00:04.214 --> 00:00:06.660
These accounts represent an identity,

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.750
used to make transactions by people,

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.910
mining nodes or contracts.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.789
In this video, we'll look at the basics of these different account types.

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:17.099
We'll also define each of the variables,

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:19.690
that are used to determine the account state.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.755
In Ethereum, there are two types of accounts.

00:00:22.754 --> 00:00:25.779
Externally owned accounts, known as EOA's,

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.885
and contract accounts known as CA's.

00:00:28.885 --> 00:00:33.445
Individuals holding a private key manage externally owned accounts.

00:00:33.445 --> 00:00:35.759
As a user on the Ethereum network,

00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:38.170
this is the type of account you would earn.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.640
There are few important fields associated with it.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.200
First, an EOA holds the account balance shown in Ether.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.910
It also includes a transaction count.

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:53.509
This count is the number of transactions that originated from the account.

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:56.210
An EOA, can do a few things.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.009
It can send transactions on the Ethereum network,

00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:00.589
call a smart contract,

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.120
and transfer value from its wallet to another account.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.960
EOA's are slightly different than contract accounts.

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:10.509
Contract accounts, or CA's,

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.290
are accounts controlled by the code within a smart contract.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.560
On top of the account balance and transaction count,

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.305
it also holds the smart contract code.

00:01:20.305 --> 00:01:24.890
In this case, the transaction count means something different than with EOA's.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.799
In CA's it refers to the number of times

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.894
this contract has deployed other smart contracts.

00:01:30.894 --> 00:01:37.045
Like an EOA, a CA can also transfer value and initiate another smart contract.

00:01:37.045 --> 00:01:42.275
When receiving transactions, a CA can execute associated smart contracts,

00:01:42.275 --> 00:01:45.000
and in some cases, manipulate storage.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.780
These accounts can be created by another CA or an EOA.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.545
As we mentioned earlier,

00:01:51.545 --> 00:01:54.894
there are a few fields that determine the state of these accounts.

00:01:54.894 --> 00:01:57.854
These fields include the nonce, balance,

00:01:57.855 --> 00:02:00.150
storage hash, code hash,

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.705
account storage and EVM code.

00:02:02.704 --> 00:02:06.245
Let's look at each of these fields in a little more detail.

00:02:06.245 --> 00:02:08.319
First the nonce.

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.959
The nonce refers to the number of transactions on the account.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.099
As we saw, this is slightly different depending on if it's an EOA or a CA.

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.799
In an EOA, this is the number of transactions sent from the accounts address.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.880
In a CA, it's the number of contracts created by the account.

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:30.764
The account balance is the total value of Ether available on the account.

00:02:30.764 --> 00:02:33.059
The balance is shown in Wei.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.675
A Wei is a smaller denomination of Ether.

00:02:35.675 --> 00:02:38.715
Like how penny is a smaller denomination of a dollar.

00:02:38.715 --> 00:02:42.289
One Ether, is equal to 10 to the 18th Wei.

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:46.025
The storage hash, is the root node of the Patricia tree.

00:02:46.025 --> 00:02:49.905
The Patricia tree is the data structure that Ethereum uses.

00:02:49.905 --> 00:02:54.044
This tree stores the hash containing the contents of the account.

00:02:54.044 --> 00:02:55.884
Next, the code hash.

00:02:55.884 --> 00:02:58.919
Is the hash of the code within the smart contract.

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:03.019
This code executes every time a call is made to the contract.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.105
While other fields can be changed,

00:03:05.104 --> 00:03:06.969
this hash cannot change.

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:11.444
This is the reason that smart contract code cannot change after it's deployed.

00:03:11.444 --> 00:03:13.614
In E0A's, there's no code.

00:03:13.615 --> 00:03:16.545
So, the code hash field is an empty string.

00:03:16.544 --> 00:03:20.074
That wraps up this overview of externally owned accounts,

00:03:20.074 --> 00:03:23.250
contract accounts, and each of their state variables.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.740
To summarize, EOA's are tied to private keys,

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.435
don't hold code, maintain a balance of Ether, and consent transactions.

00:03:31.435 --> 00:03:34.550
CA's, have code, a balance of Ether and can

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.430
execute this code when triggered by transactions or messages.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.540
Coming up, we'll look at the types of transactions and messages that exist.

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:45.560
This will help us better understand,

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.920
how transactions take place between EOA's and CA's.
