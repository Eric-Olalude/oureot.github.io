00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.285
Using the Test Ether, you just got for the Rinkeby Test Net,

00:00:03.285 --> 00:00:05.715
you can now deploy your DAPp to the test net.

00:00:05.715 --> 00:00:07.890
In this video, I'll show you how to do that.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.720
It's actually pretty simple.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.190
By the end of this video,

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.160
my goal is to have you deploy contract to the test network,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.220
make some transactions, and view them on Etherscan.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.470
To start, go back to Remix.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.930
This should still have the smart contract from earlier.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.030
If not, go back and grab the code again,

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.085
or type what you see here.

00:00:26.085 --> 00:00:30.600
From there, switch to MetaMask and make sure you're on the Rinkeby Test Net,

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.075
and that there are some ether in your account.

00:00:33.075 --> 00:00:35.685
Great, looks like I'm all set up.

00:00:35.685 --> 00:00:38.985
Now, switch back to Remix and deploy your contract.

00:00:38.985 --> 00:00:43.010
You should see creation of message pending show up in your Remix terminal.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.170
What's happening here is that it's waiting for you

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.365
to confirm the transaction for MetaMask.

00:00:47.365 --> 00:00:50.450
Open MetaMask backup and you'll see a transaction labeled,

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.215
Contract Deployment with a specific gas fee associated with it.

00:00:54.215 --> 00:00:56.975
The gas fee is the cost of making a transaction

00:00:56.975 --> 00:00:59.855
and deploying contract is considered a transaction.

00:00:59.855 --> 00:01:01.445
We'll cover more on this later.

00:01:01.445 --> 00:01:04.215
You can hit Confirm to accept the transaction.

00:01:04.215 --> 00:01:06.890
Now, look back to the Remix terminal again.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.370
At first, there'll be a link to this transaction on Etherscan,

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.625
and shortly after, you'll see that this message has been confirmed.

00:01:13.625 --> 00:01:16.640
The reason for this delay is that the transaction is waiting for

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.210
confirmation from the network of nodes that are supporting the test network.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.790
Once completed, this confirmation status will

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.550
show up in both the terminal and in MetaMask.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.960
Click on the link to view this transaction on the test network using Etherscan.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.295
What you'll see here is that the transaction you made is live on the test network.

00:01:34.295 --> 00:01:36.470
You can view all the details from Etherscan

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.245
just like any other transaction you looked up before.

00:01:39.245 --> 00:01:43.370
You can also use the contract link to view the details of your contract.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:44.735
It shows the balance,

00:01:44.735 --> 00:01:47.795
the transactions, the contract creator, and more.

00:01:47.795 --> 00:01:50.570
Down here is the details of all the transactions,

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.145
which right now is just one.

00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:54.935
There's also the block that your transaction is on and

00:01:54.935 --> 00:01:58.430
other information like how long ago the transaction was made.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.890
In the Code tab, you won't see much yet

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.385
because this isn't considered a verified contract.

00:02:03.385 --> 00:02:06.590
You can click the link to see the steps needed to verify the contract,

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.435
but we won't be doing that here.

00:02:08.435 --> 00:02:10.750
If you do get the contract verified,

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.855
you'll see it show up under the Blockchain tab by clicking Verified Contracts.

00:02:14.855 --> 00:02:18.905
So, hopefully now, you have a contract published to the Ethereum test network.

00:02:18.905 --> 00:02:22.030
You can make a few transactions by setting messages if you'd like,

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.075
and you'll see each of those appeared on the test network too.

00:02:25.075 --> 00:02:29.000
Remember, each time, you'll need to confirm the transaction using MetaMask,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.815
wait a little for it to get confirmed,

00:02:30.815 --> 00:02:32.885
and then be able to view it on Etherscan.

00:02:32.885 --> 00:02:34.790
This can be a slow process,

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.645
and that's something we'll talk a little more about soon.

00:02:37.645 --> 00:02:41.990
Either way, it's cool to see your transactions going live so easily.

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.990
The last thing I'll point out is that under input data,

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.225
it doesn't actually show the message that you typed,

00:02:47.225 --> 00:02:49.210
it shows it in a different format.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.365
To view it how you originally typed it,

00:02:51.365 --> 00:02:53.885
click on the drop-down and select UTF-8.

00:02:53.885 --> 00:02:57.830
Once you do that, you'll see the original message you sent with the transaction.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.420
Using the same pattern,

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.925
you could also deploy contracts to the main network.

00:03:01.925 --> 00:03:05.880
In this case, all you need to do is switch your MetaMask account to the main network,

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.725
deploy another contract, and go through this exact same process again.

00:03:09.725 --> 00:03:12.200
One reason we won't be deploying to the main network

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.450
much is that it costs you ether to do this,

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.510
and to get ether on the main network costs real money.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.930
The process is almost completely the same as deploying to the test network,

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.450
so you'll still know pretty much how to do it for yourself.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.580
But having to pay for every deployment,

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.640
especially early on without knowing some of the security risks,

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.965
can be limiting to your experience as a developer.

00:03:30.965 --> 00:03:34.580
For that reason, I'll point out ways that you could deploy to the main network,

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.445
but we'll generally avoid that process while we're learning.

00:03:37.445 --> 00:03:39.440
That wraps up this video for now.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.605
Hopefully at this point, you can now deploy a contract from Remix to the test network,

00:03:43.605 --> 00:03:47.130
and can investigate the transactions you make for yourself.
