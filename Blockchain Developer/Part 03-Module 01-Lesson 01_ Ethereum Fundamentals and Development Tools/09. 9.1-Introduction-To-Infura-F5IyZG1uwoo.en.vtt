00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.585
In this video, I'll introduce you to a tool named Infura.

00:00:03.585 --> 00:00:06.210
I'll talk a little bit about why you would use this tool,

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.455
what the alternatives are,

00:00:07.455 --> 00:00:10.215
and how it works with your development environment.

00:00:10.215 --> 00:00:15.045
As you can see, Infura pitches themselves as your access to the Ethereum Network.

00:00:15.045 --> 00:00:18.405
It's an API instead of developer tools that provide secure,

00:00:18.405 --> 00:00:22.185
reliable, and scalable access to Ethereum and IPFS.

00:00:22.185 --> 00:00:25.590
This isn't related yet but you might not have seen the term IPFS yet.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.090
That'll come up a little later.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.335
As a quick overview, where Ethereum can decentralize the computation across a network,

00:00:31.335 --> 00:00:34.035
IPFS can decentralize the storage.

00:00:34.035 --> 00:00:35.755
We'll get to this later in the program,

00:00:35.755 --> 00:00:37.805
but you can look this up more on your own if you like.

00:00:37.805 --> 00:00:40.700
This comes from the type of ideas we learned earlier with Bitcoin that

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.820
Blockchains are actually a terrible place to store things.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.400
Things like IPFS have come along to make

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.370
decentralizing storage a more viable option than to put it directly on the Blockchain.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.835
So anyway, back to Infura.

00:00:53.835 --> 00:00:56.760
So to start, why would you need Infura at all?

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.350
Well, once you can make API calls to the Ethereum Blockchain,

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.740
you still need to make the connection that allows those calls to go through.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.895
To do that, you'll need to have access to a Blockchain.

00:01:06.895 --> 00:01:11.845
One way to do this, is to install your own local node using a tool such as Geth.

00:01:11.845 --> 00:01:16.415
Doing this downloads an entire copy of the Blockchain to your local environment.

00:01:16.415 --> 00:01:18.425
Once you have the data downloaded,

00:01:18.425 --> 00:01:20.800
it's yours to access from your development environment.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.405
No inferior needed.

00:01:22.405 --> 00:01:24.160
The issue with this approach is,

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.410
that you need to have the storage available to download

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.370
the entire Blockchain or at least a test Blockchain to your local computer.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.530
From there, you need to keep it sync and it will

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.650
continue to eat up storage as the Blockchain grows.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.985
Currently sitting at over 6.5 million blocks and many, many,

00:01:39.985 --> 00:01:41.575
many gigabytes of data,

00:01:41.575 --> 00:01:44.495
this just isn't feasible for a lot of situations.

00:01:44.495 --> 00:01:46.860
So, that's where Infura comes in.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.440
Rather than downloading a node and having direct access to it locally,

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.680
Infura provides a way for you to connect to nodes remotely.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.500
To make this happen, they set up endpoint URLs,

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.205
that when provided as the connection to Web three,

00:01:59.205 --> 00:02:00.950
give you access to call the network

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.350
specified similar to how you would do in your own local node.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.830
So, at this point, you would have access to

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.310
a full node without having to download it on your own computer.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.560
A potential downside to this is that you do need an internet connection for this to work,

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.650
but given the alternative I see this as a much simpler way to get started.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.240
Even large applications including CryptoKitties and MetaMask like you've seen earlier,

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.520
use this tool to access the Ethereum network.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.515
So, it's not even that you're using a tool that isn't extremely powerful.

00:02:29.515 --> 00:02:31.740
From what I've seen so far, if anything,

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.160
it allows your application to scale and support

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.415
their user base much better than if you were to use a local node.

00:02:37.415 --> 00:02:41.195
I'm sure that's up for debate and I know there are pros and cons to each approach,

00:02:41.195 --> 00:02:43.490
but Infura is my personal preference.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.730
So by going through the details of why you might want to use it,

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.775
I may have clouded up the details of how to use it a little bit.

00:02:49.775 --> 00:02:52.100
Before wrapping up, I wanted to quickly go over

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.560
how it will work to connect to the main network.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.050
We'll be doing all of this in the video below.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.580
First, you set up an Infura account and get the main network and point they provide.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.525
Then, from your terminal you connect to Web three.

00:03:04.525 --> 00:03:10.010
Finally, within Web three you set up a connection to the URL endpoint, Infura provided.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.410
It's one line of code and you're all set.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.690
From there, you'll make a Web three call,

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.060
that call will use the Infura connection to reach a remote a theory of

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.745
node and that Ethereum node will return the Blockchain data you're requesting.

00:03:22.745 --> 00:03:26.630
That's it, full access to the entire Ethereum Blockchain.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.780
Okay, so hopefully now you understand how Infura works,

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:30.935
why you'd want to use it,

00:03:30.935 --> 00:03:33.065
and are excited to get started for yourself.

00:03:33.065 --> 00:03:35.580
Coming up, you'll set up an account with Infura,

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.600
connect your environment, and get access to the Ethereum Blockchain using Web three.
