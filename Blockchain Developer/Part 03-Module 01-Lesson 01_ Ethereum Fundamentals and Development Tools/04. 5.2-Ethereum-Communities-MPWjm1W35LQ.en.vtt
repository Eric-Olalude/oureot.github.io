00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.600
As you just saw, there's a huge amount of tools that

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.120
exist in the Ethereum developer ecosystem.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.160
While it can seem overwhelming at first,

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.770
the important thing to realize is that you're not alone.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.700
All these tools were built by a Ethereums thriving ecosystem of developers,

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.520
and they've also built communities to connect with one another.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.930
A huge part of becoming

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.275
an Ethereum blockchain developer is connecting to these communities.

00:00:22.275 --> 00:00:24.000
They'll give you help when you need it.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.220
Help you learn about new ideas in the space,

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.060
and give you the opportunity to give back and support others when they might need it too.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.820
So, before moving on,

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.310
I'll show you how to quickly get involved with some of these communities.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.650
An easy way to find them is to go back to

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.515
etherium.org and scroll to the bottom of the page.

00:00:39.515 --> 00:00:41.315
Here, you'll see the community,

00:00:41.315 --> 00:00:45.290
details about the Ethereum Foundation and some developer resources.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.570
On their blog, you'll see announcements about

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.020
things that are going on with the Ethereum Foundation.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.070
Things like sponsorships, grants bugfixes, and more.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.890
Will show up on this blog and it's definitely worth checking out from time to time.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.330
On their GitHub page, you'll find the code

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.745
behind all the projects they are currently working on.

00:01:01.745 --> 00:01:05.090
To start, search through this page to learn more about these projects.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.340
Later, you can look further into the code to

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.830
see exactly how Ethereum works under the hood.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.180
As you get more advanced,

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.395
you can even start contributing code to the projects for yourself.

00:01:14.395 --> 00:01:17.740
The Ethereum YouTube page is another great space to learn about

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.095
both the details of Ethereum and the latest news in the space.

00:01:21.095 --> 00:01:23.250
Everything from descriptions to basic,

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.040
intermediate, and advanced topics,

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.500
as well as talks given by developers at conferences can be found on their YouTube page.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.555
I suggest starting with this main video.

00:01:31.555 --> 00:01:34.775
It gives a great introduction to the Ethereum world computer.

00:01:34.775 --> 00:01:37.270
On their Reddit page, like any Reddit page,

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.825
you'll find discussions between people across topics related to Ethereum.

00:01:40.825 --> 00:01:42.940
You can check out their Subreddit to see what

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.090
the latest discussions are and you can usually find some critical topics that come up.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.470
Ethereums community chat is located on Gitter.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.080
Gitter is an instant messaging chat application that

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.885
splits up chats in the rooms based on important topics.

00:01:55.885 --> 00:01:57.980
As you can see, there's a lot of people in

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.325
these rooms with more than 15,000 just in the welcome room.

00:02:01.325 --> 00:02:03.420
You'll never run out of conversation if you get

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.940
involved with the Ethereum Gitter chat rooms.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.195
Look you already know some of these terms;

00:02:08.195 --> 00:02:12.695
go-ethereum is Geth, then there's solidity, Web3 and remix.

00:02:12.695 --> 00:02:16.550
You'll even find tutorials here that'll help you out with some of these tools.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.805
For even more news about what's going on in the Ethereum space,

00:02:19.805 --> 00:02:22.025
you could follow their Twitter or Facebook page.

00:02:22.025 --> 00:02:24.110
You might already be on top of the news shared here

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.360
if you're deeply involved with the other communities,

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.315
but it's a great way to get the best highlights and stay up to date.

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:30.860
Once you start developing,

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.780
you'll probably have a lot of questions.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.965
The place to go for answers to development needs is the the Ethereum Stack Exchange.

00:02:36.965 --> 00:02:39.580
This works the same stack for any other tool.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.495
If you're unfamiliar with it at this point,

00:02:41.495 --> 00:02:43.120
welcome to your new best friend.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.475
Finally, there's tons of events taking place all over the world.

00:02:46.475 --> 00:02:49.160
If you want to get out and meet people throughout these communities,

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.990
Meetup is the perfect place to look.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.675
Things really start to get exciting when you get out and talk with

00:02:53.675 --> 00:02:57.010
other people that are excited about developing on the Ethereum platform.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.130
Who knows, maybe soon you'll be running your own local Meetups. All right.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.725
So, that wraps up a quick look at the Ethereum communities.

00:03:03.725 --> 00:03:07.040
Getting involved with the community of developers is really the difference maker

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.690
when it comes to truly making an impact with decentralized applications.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.505
Hopefully, you take the time to join some of these communities,

00:03:13.505 --> 00:03:16.320
and when you do, maybe I'll see you there.
