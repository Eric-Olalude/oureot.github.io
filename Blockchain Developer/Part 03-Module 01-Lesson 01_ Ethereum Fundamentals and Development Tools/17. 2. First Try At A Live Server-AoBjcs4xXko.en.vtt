00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.795
In the last video, you got up and running with the front-end connected to the blockchain.

00:00:04.795 --> 00:00:08.260
You check the functionality by opening the HTML file.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.920
The next step you'll need to do is get it on a local host.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.680
When you do that, you'll encounter any errors you made in

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.280
your setup and be able to connect to existing tools more effectively.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.100
In this video, I'll walk through this process by starting

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.265
a local server testing my DApp and then taking note of any errors that come up.

00:00:25.265 --> 00:00:26.530
To serve my site locally,

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.240
I use something called light server.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.735
You can download this for yourself or serve it however you prefer.

00:00:31.735 --> 00:00:34.870
On my end, I'll just click down here on Go Live.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.350
That opens up my site and I can see how I did so far.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.095
I'll open up my console to see how it looks.

00:00:41.095 --> 00:00:43.360
So far, everything looks great.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.725
I'll send a message, "Hey Ethereum," to see how this button works.

00:00:47.725 --> 00:00:50.890
When I do that, I see an error that comes up.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.810
What it says is that the Web3 object does not

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.420
support synchronous methods without a callback parameter.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.445
So, what happened here?

00:00:58.445 --> 00:01:00.710
Well, if I look back to my code,

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.185
I can see that I never set this line as a callback.

00:01:03.185 --> 00:01:05.060
This idea has come up in the past,

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.890
but it's an important distinction to show.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.800
If you're working with just your HTML file loaded up,

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.630
you may be overlooking some important things

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.170
like callbacks that will come back to you later on.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.350
So, given that you know the error,

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.000
see if you can rewrite this line as a callback so that the error goes away.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.415
You can pause the video to try it for yourself.

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:25.255
If not, I'll show you how to fix this now.

00:01:25.255 --> 00:01:27.955
First, to help keep things a little cleaner,

00:01:27.955 --> 00:01:31.490
I'll pull out the user input and set it to a variable named message.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.835
Then, I can call that variable from within setMessage.

00:01:34.835 --> 00:01:36.940
Next, I'll write the callback.

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.970
This is similar to the syntax we've used before and hopefully should look familiar.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.910
Once I do this, we should have fix the error.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.725
I'll go back to my site,

00:01:45.725 --> 00:01:48.685
reload the page, and try inputting the message again.

00:01:48.685 --> 00:01:51.105
Cool. By adding the callback function,

00:01:51.105 --> 00:01:53.765
I can now set messages and there's no more errors.

00:01:53.765 --> 00:01:57.815
I'll open up Ganache to watch the transactions log onto the blockchain.

00:01:57.815 --> 00:02:01.070
I'll send, "Everything works."

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.500
No transaction showed up.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.335
I'll try again. "Hello, does everything work?"

00:02:07.335 --> 00:02:11.825
Well, it's in my console but there's no transaction being logged on my blockchain.

00:02:11.825 --> 00:02:14.780
Alternatively, you might get a message that looks like this,

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.420
"Uncaught error, invalid address."

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.945
In both cases, these are happening for a similar reason.

00:02:20.945 --> 00:02:23.570
Take a minute to think about why this is going on.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.920
Keep in mind that we're on a live server right now.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.250
So we're expected to have tool setup in the same way

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.240
that they would be when our users are interacting with our DApp.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.030
If you're not sure, don't worry.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.670
In the next video, I'll show you what the problem is and how we can fix it.
