00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120
If you prefer a graphical user interface over command-line interface,

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.665
this lesson will introduce you to that.

00:00:07.665 --> 00:00:13.914
So, let's head over to ethereum.org and got this up and running here,

00:00:13.914 --> 00:00:18.059
and download the Ethereum graphical user interface.

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:21.599
I use a Mac so I'm going to go download that particular version.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.915
So you click on this button called download.

00:00:23.914 --> 00:00:28.070
So, the installation page would look something like this.

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:32.270
If you use a different computer or an operating system,

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.635
you click on all versions and you can bring the appropriate version.

00:00:37.634 --> 00:00:39.388
So, if you use a Linux,

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:41.915
download the Linux 32 or 64,

00:00:41.914 --> 00:00:43.854
if you got a Mac,

00:00:43.854 --> 00:00:44.909
so I'm using Mac so,

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:47.264
I'll download this particular version here.

00:00:47.265 --> 00:00:50.924
After you download and you go to the installations,

00:00:50.924 --> 00:00:55.184
it'll install the applications folder,

00:00:55.185 --> 00:00:57.755
and then when you bring it up,

00:00:57.755 --> 00:00:59.975
when you launch the application,

00:00:59.975 --> 00:01:05.320
the Ethereum graphical user interface would look something like this.

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:08.954
So, what it contains basically,

00:01:08.954 --> 00:01:12.594
right now I'm connected to the test network,

00:01:12.594 --> 00:01:15.539
so you got the main Ropsten and Rinkeby,

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.800
some connect to Rinkeby.

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:24.185
In this illustration, you got four accounts Mist account 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:01:24.185 --> 00:01:26.460
I'm on accounts overview.

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.384
One thing to note is the ether that I have over here,

00:01:33.385 --> 00:01:34.520
it's play ether, so,

00:01:34.519 --> 00:01:37.759
you can use this ether in the main net,

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.185
so, this only work under incubator network.

00:01:40.185 --> 00:01:41.680
So, give this a crack,

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:48.155
see you're able to installed the graphical UI with the Ethereum wallet in the Mist,

00:01:48.155 --> 00:01:50.510
and if you don't have any accounts,

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.329
I think it's usually have one account to begin with,

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:55.039
and you can try adding new accounts as well.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.805
In the next lesson, what I'll do,

00:01:56.805 --> 00:02:02.000
I'll show you the different network types and how you can connect through that.
