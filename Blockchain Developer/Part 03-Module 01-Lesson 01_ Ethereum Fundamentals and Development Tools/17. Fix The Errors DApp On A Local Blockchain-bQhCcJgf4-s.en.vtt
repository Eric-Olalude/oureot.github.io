00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.220
Welcome back. Hopefully, you had some time to

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.620
think about what could be going wrong with our Depth.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.570
In this video, I'll show you how to fix a depth,

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.030
so that it logs information to the blockchain.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.050
The problem here comes from a tool that hasn't come up for a bit,

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.280
but it's extremely important for allowing users

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.040
to make interactions with our blockchain applications.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.405
To write information to the blockchain from our Depth, we'll need MetaMask.

00:00:21.405 --> 00:00:24.205
MetaMask can connect to the test and main networks,

00:00:24.205 --> 00:00:26.615
but it can also connect to our local blockchain.

00:00:26.615 --> 00:00:28.370
Once we get this setup correctly,

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.260
we'll have an account connected to our site

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.755
that can confirm the transactions we're trying to make.

00:00:32.755 --> 00:00:36.665
First, I'll explain each of the errors you might have faced and afterwards,

00:00:36.665 --> 00:00:38.345
I hope you get setup correctly.

00:00:38.345 --> 00:00:41.120
I'll warn you now, that even after we fix this first error,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.005
there's one more that's going to come up and we'll fix that too.

00:00:44.005 --> 00:00:46.940
The reason for not just getting you set up right away correctly,

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.255
was that you're going to run into errors like this at some point for yourself.

00:00:50.255 --> 00:00:53.465
Doing it perfectly the first time in these videos, sounds great.

00:00:53.465 --> 00:00:55.340
But if I don't show you this all now,

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.750
you might end up loss later on,

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.780
and I'd like to try to help as much as I can.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.680
So, hopefully, you'll learn a lot. Let's get started.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.650
First, I'll explain why there could have been

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.025
no error message or the invalid address error message.

00:01:07.025 --> 00:01:09.290
Either way, we'll be doing the same thing to fix it,

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.890
but what happened at first depends on how your setup with MetaMask right now.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.140
Earlier in the lesson, you were asked to get

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.690
some test net coins by logging onto the test network.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.125
If you did, you might still be logged onto that network right now.

00:01:21.125 --> 00:01:23.360
In this case, you'll see that there's a number of

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.745
transactions here waiting to be confirmed.

00:01:25.745 --> 00:01:29.030
If you go to accept these transactions though, they'll fail.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.970
That's because you're connected to the test network and are trying to

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.390
verify transactions that are being made on a local blockchain.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.980
In this case, you'll need to change your connection to the local blockchain.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.575
The other possibility, is that you receive the invalid addresser.

00:01:42.575 --> 00:01:44.540
This happens because when you're logged out,

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.580
the Depth can immediately recognize that there's not

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.120
even an account that could verify the transactions,

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.620
so those are two different things that could be going on.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.750
In one example, the transaction is sent to

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.045
an account that can't confirm it and in another,

00:01:56.045 --> 00:01:57.845
the transaction can't be sent at all.

00:01:57.845 --> 00:02:01.565
I thought it was worth pointing out both cases in case you run into them for yourselves.

00:02:01.565 --> 00:02:03.500
One thing that can get tough with all these new tools,

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.260
is juggling the amount of connections to networks that you'll have.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.925
There's a lot of tools linking together,

00:02:07.925 --> 00:02:09.919
so keep this in mind when you build your Depths.

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:11.585
To make this work, what you'll need to do,

00:02:11.585 --> 00:02:13.835
is connect MetaMask to your local blockchain.

00:02:13.835 --> 00:02:15.440
If you haven't already,

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.945
create an account now like we went over earlier in the lesson.

00:02:17.945 --> 00:02:19.295
If you do have an account,

00:02:19.295 --> 00:02:21.035
you can go ahead and login.

00:02:21.035 --> 00:02:24.325
Once logged in, you'll need to connect to your local blockchain.

00:02:24.325 --> 00:02:27.015
For Ganache CLI, you can connect to local host

00:02:27.015 --> 00:02:29.815
8545 and if you're on the graphic interface,

00:02:29.815 --> 00:02:31.835
you'll need to use the custom RPC.

00:02:31.835 --> 00:02:34.100
After selecting the custom RPC,

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.090
you can scroll down and place the graphic interface URL right here.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.720
After hitting save, the connection will show up on your main menu.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.010
Once on this network,

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.940
you can now import any of the accounts that are available in your local blockchain.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.165
To do this, grab the private key of any account you want, copy it,

00:02:51.165 --> 00:02:53.790
opened MetaMask, click the icon on the top right,

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.780
and select Import Account.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.220
Paste in your private key, hit save,

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.475
and you now should have an account in MetaMask with 100 ether.

00:03:01.475 --> 00:03:03.170
Great. We're getting somewhere.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.680
Another thing that happened that I'll call out for you, is in Remix.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.495
When you switch your meta mask account,

00:03:08.495 --> 00:03:11.390
it reloads Remix and kill the contract you deployed.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.970
That's annoying, but MetaMask did that to inject a new Web3 provider into your page.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.600
For our project, we'll need to switch the provider back to Web3 and connect to Ganache,

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.580
then redeploy the contract.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.290
From there, copy the address and replace the current address in your code editor.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.155
Don't worry about the ABI though.

00:03:29.155 --> 00:03:31.050
Since nothing in the contract changed,

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.875
then the ABI will be the same and you can keep the original one.

00:03:33.875 --> 00:03:37.415
All right. So, that's the end of all of our problems, for now.

00:03:37.415 --> 00:03:40.250
Save your file and everything should hopefully be okay now.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.705
Go back to your site, refresh the browser and set a secret message.

00:03:43.705 --> 00:03:48.080
You might see a pop-up come up or maybe just the number appears in your MetaMask image.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.355
Either way, open MetaMask and you'll see your transaction waiting to be confirmed.

00:03:52.355 --> 00:03:53.840
It will cause some guests,

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.895
but that's fine because it's free.

00:03:55.895 --> 00:03:58.805
Hit confirm to see the transaction go through.

00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:03.415
Great. I can see it here in Ganache and if everything worked out, you should see it too.

00:04:03.415 --> 00:04:06.800
You're all set up to make and confirm as many transaction as you like.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.055
At this point, you're well prepared to set up a connection between Remix,

00:04:10.055 --> 00:04:14.990
a Front-end, MetaMask, and Ganache to build and test smart contracts however you like.

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.185
You can stop here and be happy.

00:04:17.185 --> 00:04:19.970
In terms of setting up an environment that you can build and deploy

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.375
Depths locally to see how user interaction would go, this is it.

00:04:23.375 --> 00:04:25.790
That said, there's always whom we're thing.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.350
Right now, every time a transaction is confirmed,

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.910
you'll get a notification for MetaMask that says you can view this transaction.

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.960
If you click that now, you'll find that it can't actually show you any transaction.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.720
What's that? Well, it's because you're on

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.475
a local blockchain and Etherscan can't view your local blockchain.

00:04:42.475 --> 00:04:44.215
The reason you're getting this message,

00:04:44.215 --> 00:04:47.360
is that I didn't yet fulfill the promise I made to you that you'll be able

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.735
to deploy to a test or main network at the end of this lesson.

00:04:50.735 --> 00:04:52.440
That's going to take some adjustments,

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.785
and we'll work on that next.

00:04:53.785 --> 00:04:55.910
Remember, you can stick with what you have and

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.055
go a long way towards building Depths right now.

00:04:58.055 --> 00:05:01.340
But, I promised actual deployments and I don't want to let you down.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.600
So, coming up I'll show you how to deploy it to the test network.
