00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.295
The goal of Ethereum is to help you build decentralized applications also known as DApps.

00:00:05.295 --> 00:00:08.775
In this video, I'll introduce you to DApps by explaining what they are,

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:11.250
what makes them different from standard applications,

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.115
and how to find some existing DApps on Ethereum network.

00:00:14.115 --> 00:00:15.930
So first, what's a DApp?

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.420
A DApp is an application that has it's back-end

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.315
code running on a decentralized peer-to-peer network.

00:00:21.315 --> 00:00:25.410
In Ethereum's case, that decentralized network is the world computer.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.050
That's different from standard applications because

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.720
those apps all run on centralized servers.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.000
In the same way that bitcoin tried to take out

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.330
the intermediaries in financial transactions,

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.250
Ethereum is attempting to do it for entire applications.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.235
Since the EVM is able to process turing-complete logic,

00:00:43.235 --> 00:00:46.025
these DApps can work similar standard applications

00:00:46.025 --> 00:00:49.295
with the difference being the distributed network that supports them.

00:00:49.295 --> 00:00:53.750
There are other platforms that you can build DApps on top of like EOS and Neo,

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.010
but Ethereum is currently

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.535
the world's leading platform for building distributed applications.

00:00:58.535 --> 00:01:01.975
Once you've built this back-end that connects to the Ethereum platform,

00:01:01.975 --> 00:01:05.080
you can continue building this app in ways you already know.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.659
Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript,

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.580
and any web frameworks or tools that you'd prefer to work in,

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.350
you can build out entire front ends to

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.755
your decentralized application that users can interact with.

00:01:15.755 --> 00:01:18.440
The core piece of code that's connecting users to

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.965
the Ethereum network through the front end you build is the smart contract.

00:01:21.965 --> 00:01:25.235
This smart contract specifies the purpose of the application

00:01:25.235 --> 00:01:28.685
and allows users to set and retrieve data from the Ethereum network.

00:01:28.685 --> 00:01:33.365
You'll soon build a smart contract and deploy it for yourself to see how easy it can be.

00:01:33.365 --> 00:01:35.465
Before building your own DApps,

00:01:35.465 --> 00:01:39.950
it can be fun to checkout existing applications that are already on the Ethereum network.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.410
Similar to the App Store or Google Play,

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.630
Ethereum has a set of applications already

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.330
live that you can check out for yourself right now.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.310
You can search for them in any browser,

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.765
but one tool I found that's pretty cool to checkout is Dappradar.

00:01:52.765 --> 00:01:55.370
Dappradar categorizes many of the DApps on

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.595
the Ethereum network and rates them based on users and volume.

00:01:58.595 --> 00:02:02.615
That gives you the opportunity to see some of the top apps out there right now.

00:02:02.615 --> 00:02:05.585
As one example, I'll click on CryptoKitties.

00:02:05.585 --> 00:02:07.125
When you first visit the website,

00:02:07.125 --> 00:02:10.729
you'll see a live DApp that allows you to collect and breed digital cats.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.410
It was one of the first biggest apps to come out and it allows you to breed,

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.965
buy, and sell collectible kittens on the Ethereum network.

00:02:17.965 --> 00:02:22.370
Well, it's just a game, it's also a great example of what's possible on the network.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.160
By breeding kittens, you're creating new instances of

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.460
an account that can be bought and sold over the Ethereum network.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.610
Over top of that functionality is a bunch of cute kittens,

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.520
but ideas like this can apply to almost anything.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.550
For each DApp you end up looking at,

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.090
it's helpful to start thinking about how

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.780
the underlying capability of the Ethereum network is making it possible.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.390
So head back to that DAppradar and take some time

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.510
now to check out that from across all the different categories.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.370
Also, if you're on your phone,

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.650
you might want to check out the Trust browser.

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.745
This Trust browser is a mobile app browser that you can use from your phone.

00:02:55.745 --> 00:02:59.795
It helps you get set up with a wallet and start browsing DApps for yourself.

00:02:59.795 --> 00:03:02.990
Look, right on the front page is a picture of CryptoKitties,

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.250
the site we just went over.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.800
So that wraps up this quick introduction to DApps,

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.440
but we'll be learning tons more about this throughout the course.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.440
Hopefully now, you have a decent idea of what the DApps are,

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.405
how they're different from standard applications

00:03:14.405 --> 00:03:17.000
and how you can start searching some of them for yourself.
