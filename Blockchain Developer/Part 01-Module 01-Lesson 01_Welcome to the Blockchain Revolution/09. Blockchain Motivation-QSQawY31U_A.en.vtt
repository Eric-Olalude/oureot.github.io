Hi everyone and welcome to the program.

00:00:02.754 --> 00:00:05.134
So to start off, I'm sitting here with Brandy,

00:00:05.134 --> 00:00:07.719
our curriculum lead for our blockchain nanodegree program.

00:00:07.719 --> 00:00:11.050
We have some questions for her before we kick off into the program.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.405
So to start, the question on all our minds is what excites you about the blockchain?

00:00:15.404 --> 00:00:17.679
I love the disruptive nature of blockchain.

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:20.004
I'm really looking forward to blockchain

00:00:20.004 --> 00:00:23.129
infecting all verticals of information technology.

00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:27.599
Excited about the way that we can tear down borders and transact with one another.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.740
That's really nice to have that freedom.

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:32.754
Next is the ability to interact with

00:00:32.755 --> 00:00:37.045
IoT like when you think about machines to machines transacting,

00:00:37.045 --> 00:00:40.050
blockchain is like the perfect marriage for being able

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:43.109
to transact at that level without needing an intermediary.

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:45.719
So it's really nice that we have the ability

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.530
to be versatile with the technology at a global scale.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.350
So I'm looking forward to increase transparency with governments,

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.265
I'm looking forward to improve electronic medical records or patient data.

00:00:57.265 --> 00:01:01.605
I think blockchain could literally infect everything that we do today with technology.

00:01:01.604 --> 00:01:05.924
I like how you covered, how blockchain can cover so many industries.

00:01:05.924 --> 00:01:08.769
Is there any one particular application that you're particular excited about?

00:01:08.769 --> 00:01:12.719
The application I love most is just breaking down the walls without having to

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:17.414
worry about borders when it comes down to transacting with various communities.

00:01:17.415 --> 00:01:20.070
I know I mentioned to you before about being able to

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:23.159
transact with folks in Africa or in Canada,

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.959
there's no different when it comes down

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:27.034
to the way that we're going to transact with one another.

00:01:27.034 --> 00:01:28.869
It's not so much just the transactions,

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.380
really the technology that's making the transaction work and

00:01:31.379 --> 00:01:34.875
the type of data that we can embed with those transactions it's

00:01:34.875 --> 00:01:37.859
quite wonderful because it allows a lot of flexibility to just take

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:41.159
advantage of the technology and allow it to affect us.

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.780
I think that's where we're at right now.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.439
We're at this point where we're going to see more maturity in the blockchain space.

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.569
Nice. I feel like the more I listen to you talk about the,

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:51.074
even more excited I get.

00:01:51.075 --> 00:01:53.750
I know there's a lot more we can continue to do

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.810
with the technology and we're just at the beginning of there right now.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.000
So with that, let's get started with the program.
