00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
At Audacity, we believe in learning by doing.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.049
Our goal is to help you develop a portfolio of projects you

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.794
can use to show future employers and even friends and family.

00:00:10.794 --> 00:00:14.009
In this video, we'll give a brief introduction to the projects

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.324
you'll complete over the next few months as you progress through the program.

00:00:17.324 --> 00:00:20.189
This program helps you build the skills you need to create

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.890
your own unique web application that uses the blockchain.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.929
This is a chance to solve a real world problem and create

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:30.425
an application that you can build to impact the world around you.

00:00:30.425 --> 00:00:32.630
Along the way, you'll complete a series of

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.615
projects that build towards completing this application.

00:00:35.615 --> 00:00:39.215
Here's a quick overview of these eight projects.

00:00:39.215 --> 00:00:40.910
In the first project,

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:43.914
you'll create and manage your own Blockchain Identity.

00:00:43.914 --> 00:00:49.109
You'll create a profile on the blockchain and start making transactions for yourself.

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:54.274
In Project 2, you'll build your own blockchain to store and manage data.

00:00:54.274 --> 00:00:56.619
Project 3 is all about connecting

00:00:56.619 --> 00:01:00.140
this blockchain to a web service that users can interact with.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.744
You'll build a service using NodeJS

00:01:02.744 --> 00:01:05.560
that allows you to work with blocks on your blockchain.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.525
In Project 4, you'll create an Identity and Notary Service.

00:01:09.525 --> 00:01:11.995
Here you'll learn to manage user profiles,

00:01:11.995 --> 00:01:14.250
service and store digital documents,

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.465
and we'll begin exploring different blockchain service layers.

00:01:17.465 --> 00:01:19.710
In Project 5, you'll start building

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:23.439
a decentralized application using the Ethereum platform.

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:26.370
Ethereum is currently the world's largest platform

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.850
for building decentralized applications.

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:33.714
Here you'll jump right in and learn Solidity, Ethereum's programming language.

00:01:33.715 --> 00:01:36.480
In Projects 6, you'll dive deeper into

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.430
the lower level components of your notarization web service.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.600
You will explore some of the lower level components of

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:47.019
the blockchain and implement more advanced features in your application.

00:01:47.019 --> 00:01:50.159
In Project 7, you'll add more functionality to

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.369
your notarization service to solve the issue of supply chain management.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.380
This will allow your app's users to track product owners from the time of

00:01:58.379 --> 00:02:03.079
product is originally made until it reaches the shelves for potential customers.

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.510
Finally, at the end of this program,

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.704
you'll complete the Capstone project.

00:02:07.704 --> 00:02:11.740
The Capstone project is the culmination of this nanodegree program.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.620
It gives you an opportunity to demonstrate everything

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.605
you've learned and apply it to a real-world problem.

00:02:17.604 --> 00:02:20.959
That wraps up the projects you'll be completing for this program.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.319
After completing each of these projects,

00:02:23.318 --> 00:02:26.935
you'll have built an in-depth understanding of blockchain technologies.

00:02:26.935 --> 00:02:29.500
You'll also have a portfolio of projects to show

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.995
employers as you continue your journey as a blockchain developer.

00:02:32.995 --> 00:02:36.855
So, welcome again to the blockchain developer nanodegree program.

00:02:36.854 --> 00:02:41.239
We're extremely excited to have you here and can't wait to see what you build.
