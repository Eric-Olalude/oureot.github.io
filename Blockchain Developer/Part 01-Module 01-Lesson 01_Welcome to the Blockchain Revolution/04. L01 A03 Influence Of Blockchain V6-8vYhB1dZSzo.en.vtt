00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.405
Blockchain is changing industries across the world including personal identification,

00:00:05.405 --> 00:00:09.935
medicine, finance, supply chain management, and even government.

00:00:09.935 --> 00:00:12.044
But what makes this possible?

00:00:12.044 --> 00:00:16.910
Basically, the Blockchain is a completely new way to share data.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.469
It allows us to make transactions in a way that are more secure,

00:00:21.469 --> 00:00:24.864
more transparent, and cheaper than before.

00:00:24.864 --> 00:00:27.369
We can do all this without large companies

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.760
collecting and managing our data like they do today.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.079
Let's discuss a few examples from industries we mentioned earlier,

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:37.320
starting with personal identity.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.119
We all want our identity to be safe.

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:44.369
No one should be able to access information about where we go,

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:48.554
what we do, or what we're planning without our permission.

00:00:48.554 --> 00:00:53.409
The problem is we often give this information over to major corporations in

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:58.890
return for the services they provide and can lose control of how our information is used.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.844
These corporations store the data we produce in large central databases.

00:01:03.844 --> 00:01:07.995
Having such important data collected into a single location,

00:01:07.995 --> 00:01:10.609
can be useful but there are some risk.

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:15.745
One risk is that it makes it a huge target for hackers to break in and steal our data.

00:01:15.745 --> 00:01:18.439
For example in 2017,

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:21.899
Equifax, a major credit bureau, was hacked.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.700
Up to 140 million Americans or

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.945
about half the United States population lost important data to hackers.

00:01:29.944 --> 00:01:32.934
These hackers gained access to credit cards,

00:01:32.935 --> 00:01:37.765
bank accounts, and all other information that Equifax had collected.

00:01:37.765 --> 00:01:40.680
So what does this have to do with Blockchain?

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.195
Well, on the Blockchain,

00:01:43.194 --> 00:01:46.289
data isn't held in a centralized database.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.310
It's shared with everyone and verified by people in the network.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.799
Information is secured using cryptography so that

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.075
criminals can't come and steal our data.

00:01:58.075 --> 00:02:01.859
This makes this type of data breach nearly impossible.

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:05.855
Next, imagine what it takes to create a new product.

00:02:05.855 --> 00:02:09.090
How do companies track the parts being shipped,

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.325
the work being done, and the ownership of each new product?

00:02:13.324 --> 00:02:18.044
Let's look at car manufacturing as an example.

00:02:18.044 --> 00:02:19.919
To build the car,

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:21.869
there are many companies involved.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.140
The shipping parts like screws,

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:26.799
panels, engines, and doors.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.000
All of these parts need to be tracked.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.250
Even after the car is built,

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.314
we need to track the car's ownership as it goes from the manufacturer,

00:02:36.314 --> 00:02:39.069
to the dealer, to the end consumer.

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.699
This process is known as the supply chain.

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:47.009
Right now, managing the supply chain is extremely messy.

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:51.724
The details and history of each part are listed across many companies.

00:02:51.724 --> 00:02:54.879
These companies usually don't share information with each

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:58.259
other and struggle to keep their records up to date.

00:02:58.259 --> 00:03:03.569
This forces companies to spend a lot of resources handling these records.

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.194
This is the space where the Blockchain can make a huge difference.

00:03:08.194 --> 00:03:14.409
On the Blockchain, the information about this car can be made publicly available.

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:18.634
This allows us to know the exact details and history

00:03:18.634 --> 00:03:23.495
of every part of the product we buy, rent, or use.

00:03:23.495 --> 00:03:24.960
You might be thinking,

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.115
"What if I don't want all this data to be shared with everyone?"

00:03:29.115 --> 00:03:30.955
That's okay too.

00:03:30.955 --> 00:03:36.410
For one thing, the information that is public is also generally anonymous.

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:39.829
This way you can be sure no one can see what you're doing.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.575
There are also other security measures

00:03:42.574 --> 00:03:46.164
built into the system that we'll discuss throughout the course.

00:03:46.164 --> 00:03:49.644
Here are a few more quick examples to show you

00:03:49.645 --> 00:03:53.415
how the Blockchain could revolutionize other industries.

00:03:53.414 --> 00:03:56.620
In medicine, we can help save lives by having

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.560
more secure and accurate patient information.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.759
We can send money across the world freely and securely,

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:07.134
potentially changing the entire financial system.

00:04:07.134 --> 00:04:12.599
Even government elections can be made more secure and transparent on the Blockchain.

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.259
With all these possibilities,

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:17.730
you have to wonder what is the Blockchain?

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.650
Where did it come from? How can you begin learning more about it?

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:25.639
We'll get into much more details about this next.
