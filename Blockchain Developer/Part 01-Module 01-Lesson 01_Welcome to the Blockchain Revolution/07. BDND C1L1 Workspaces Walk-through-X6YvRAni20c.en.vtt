00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.940
Welcome back. I'm confident that you're

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.430
enjoying your Blockchain nanodegree program so far.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.520
Things will start to get even more interesting from now on,

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.605
you are going to be building amazing projects

00:00:10.605 --> 00:00:12.810
that would be helpful in advancing your career.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.870
Now, just want to let you know that some of you might not have the environment

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.080
set up in terms of Node, JavaScript, compilers, etc.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.200
For those students, we at Udacity are going to give you

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.320
complete development environment that is called the workspace,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.630
and this is integrated into your classroom.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.095
Now of course, you're welcome to use your own environment if you have that setup.

00:00:31.095 --> 00:00:33.180
If you don't, you don't have to worry,

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.250
you can obviously use the Udacity's integrated classroom workspace

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.875
that is going to be pre-installed with Node.

00:00:39.875 --> 00:00:44.180
Also want to let you know that your workspace is backed by Linux virtual machine.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.620
That means you're going to have complete access to a terminal, and Node packages,

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.850
and you can install packages,

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:50.930
you can modify content,

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.145
you can do git clone,

00:00:52.145 --> 00:00:54.715
and etc, and all that stuff.

00:00:54.715 --> 00:00:57.470
I'm going to now walk you through so that you are ready

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.570
to work on your all upcoming projects.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.745
So let's walk through our workspace right now.

00:01:01.745 --> 00:01:03.050
So walking through here,

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.985
if you see there's three sections.

00:01:04.985 --> 00:01:06.830
This is the navigator section,

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.230
this is your coding section,

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.670
and this is your terminal section.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.205
So let me explain you a little bit in detail about all the three sections.

00:01:13.205 --> 00:01:15.855
The site section is the file navigator section,

00:01:15.855 --> 00:01:17.300
so you can open directories,

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.710
you can go to a specific directory,

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.510
you can go into directories.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.790
So if you see, this is the path you're in right now,

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.815
so pay attention to that.

00:01:24.815 --> 00:01:26.480
You can open up files,

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.180
whatever files you open up show up in this window right here.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.775
So all your open files is your section, this here.

00:01:31.775 --> 00:01:33.680
This is also your coding section.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.400
That means any code that you can be writing in any of the files appears right here.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.205
Now, look at this plus button right there.

00:01:41.205 --> 00:01:42.490
In the navigator section,

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.820
you can upload files,

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.920
you can upload folders, you can create files,

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.200
you can also create folders from this section.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.200
So let's say you have an assignment or a project you're working on,

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.110
and you're supposed to send us a file and you did that on your computer.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.530
You can upload files for your workspace using this button right there.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.990
Walking through this section,

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.220
this is a terminal section.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.440
That means if you need to run code,

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.475
that this whole environment is preset with Node.

00:02:07.475 --> 00:02:08.845
That means you can open up,

00:02:08.845 --> 00:02:10.380
just click on this plus sign,

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.000
and it opens up a terminal for you.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.180
If you wish, if you're running multiple scripts,

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.620
you can always open up multiple terminals by another plus button.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.445
I'm just going to open one for now.

00:02:18.445 --> 00:02:20.290
So now you can run any Node commands,

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.300
you can install packages using npm just because like I said,

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.535
it's already pre-configured with Node.

00:02:25.535 --> 00:02:27.785
You can clone, git clone,

00:02:27.785 --> 00:02:29.340
all that stuff can happen right there.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.060
So this is your terminal for running all pieces of code,

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.760
running files and all that scripts.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.845
So this is a terminal section again,

00:02:36.845 --> 00:02:37.880
this is a coding section,

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.155
this is a navigator section.

00:02:39.155 --> 00:02:42.085
A couple of buttons we also wanted to walk you through is a menu button.

00:02:42.085 --> 00:02:46.400
If your workspace is giving you any issues and you would like to refresh your workspace,

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.245
you can always do that by clicking Refresh.

00:02:48.245 --> 00:02:50.540
Also just want to let you know if you refresh workspace,

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:51.935
all your files will be saved.

00:02:51.935 --> 00:02:53.075
Nothing is going to be deleted,

00:02:53.075 --> 00:02:55.365
it's all still going to be there for you.

00:02:55.365 --> 00:02:58.160
For whatever reason, if you like to reset all the data,

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.960
you can always click on Reset Data,

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.090
which means all your code and your files will be lost using that option.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.450
So menu shrink, talked about that.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.560
Pretty simple to use,

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.280
is a complete built-in environment for running files,

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.370
running scripts, and related information.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.410
Now, in your next section,

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.020
I'm going to actually give you your complete workspace

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.840
that you can walk through and play around,

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.240
open up files, run scripts,

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.985
and install packages and see what you can possibly do with it,

00:03:25.985 --> 00:03:30.845
so that you are all ready to work on your projects using this workspace from now on.

00:03:30.845 --> 00:03:34.650
So again, welcome to your workspace. Enjoy using it.
