00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.129
As you can probably tell,

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.774
there's a lot more behind what makes a Blockchain work besides the Blockchain.

00:00:06.775 --> 00:00:11.405
Getting accurate information onto the Blockchain is the goal of the entire system,

00:00:11.404 --> 00:00:15.774
but it's helpful to understand it as a single component of this larger system.

00:00:15.775 --> 00:00:19.010
In this video, we'll go over what a Blockchain is,

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.890
how it's created, and some ways it has been made to ensure a secure and accurate dataset.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.910
A Blockchain is a shared digital ledger that

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.365
contains the entire history of transactions made on the network.

00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:34.210
It's an accumulation of linked blocks joined

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.755
together by hash values that have been created over time.

00:00:37.755 --> 00:00:42.250
All information on a Blockchain is permanent and can't be changed.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.935
This means that the data is immutable.

00:00:44.935 --> 00:00:46.539
When using a Blockchain,

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:49.560
you have a permanent unchanging history of information,

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.469
which is useful for many different applications.

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.240
To construct a Blockchain,

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.945
you need two main things;

00:00:55.945 --> 00:00:57.965
blocks and hash values.

00:00:57.965 --> 00:01:03.565
As we've seen, every block contains its own hash plus the hash of the previous block.

00:01:03.564 --> 00:01:06.799
These hash values chain the blocks together in order from

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:11.009
the most recent block made all the way to the first block ever created.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.160
The fact that these blocks are connected by

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.484
hash values gives them some pretty interesting qualities.

00:01:16.484 --> 00:01:19.040
First, we know that if we change the data on

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.350
a block that it will create a new hash value for that block.

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:25.959
That will invalidate the block and we'll know it's been changed.

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:29.375
But what happens when we look at that block as part of a chain?

00:01:29.375 --> 00:01:32.290
Well, since the hash for the block changes,

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.025
it also changes the hash for this block that exists on the next block.

00:01:36.025 --> 00:01:40.109
This changes the data in that block changing the hash value,

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:42.825
and now this gets invalidated too.

00:01:42.825 --> 00:01:45.810
This change of hash values runs all the way down

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.290
the set of blocks effectively breaking the entire chain.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.785
You can identify any block on the chain by where it is located using its block number.

00:01:54.784 --> 00:01:59.094
The block number is just the number four where on the chain that block falls.

00:01:59.094 --> 00:02:01.689
The third block will have a block number three,

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:03.474
the second number two,

00:02:03.474 --> 00:02:06.229
and the first block will be called block number one.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.485
The first block on the chain also goes by another name.

00:02:09.485 --> 00:02:11.875
It is known as the genesis block,

00:02:11.875 --> 00:02:15.694
and when it comes to the block chain and what it actually is, that's really it.

00:02:15.694 --> 00:02:18.370
The system surrounding the development, updates,

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.925
and ideas about how to best support the chain is where it can get more complicated.

00:02:22.925 --> 00:02:26.550
As we continue discussing these topics about the Blockchain,

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.140
keep in mind that the Blockchain itself is just a single component within all of this,

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:33.809
where the transaction history is eventually stored.
