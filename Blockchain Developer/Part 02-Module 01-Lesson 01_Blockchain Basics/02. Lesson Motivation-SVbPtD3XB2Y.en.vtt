All right, I'm here with Brandy and we're about to get started with the first lesson,

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:05.599
where we talked about the fundamentals of the blockchain.

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:07.439
So Brandy, I was wondering why is it important

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.475
that we understand the fundamentals of blockchain?

00:00:09.474 --> 00:00:10.734
Is super important, Joe,

00:00:10.734 --> 00:00:12.924
because it's new technology, right?

00:00:12.925 --> 00:00:15.929
It's something that we're learning to work with now,

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.350
and there's so many advancements going on in the blockchain space

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.480
that each of these investments are coming

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.745
with rules and regulations like with the protocol.

00:00:23.745 --> 00:00:26.440
So we need to explore the fundamentals of

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.405
blockchain to understand the protocol and ways that we can work with it.

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:33.164
So in the first project will be establishing are blockchain identity.

00:00:33.164 --> 00:00:36.649
Now, I was wondering how this lesson relates to making that happen?

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:38.984
Well, we know that we need to learn the fundamentals because

00:00:38.984 --> 00:00:41.670
this new technology we kind of touched base

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.765
on the need to understand the protocol, right?

00:00:44.765 --> 00:00:49.409
And blockchain identity is really about setting up your identity on blockchain.

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:54.524
So you can start manipulating and working with services as you create your application.

00:00:54.524 --> 00:00:57.119
So, that's why it's the very first project because we

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:59.979
need establish our identity for bockchain services.

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:01.964
Great, thanks Brandy. So throughout the lesson,

00:01:01.965 --> 00:01:03.510
we're going to get started with the fundamentals of

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:06.359
the blockchain and we hope you're ready to get started.
