00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
Hello, everyone. I am Cezanne Camacho.

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.760
I teach deep learning and computer vision at Udacity.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.845
Today I'm with Kyle Samani,

00:00:07.845 --> 00:00:12.330
who is the co-founder and managing partner at Multicoin Capital.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.315
Maybe you could tell us a bit about what multi-coin does.

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:16.980
Hey Cezanne. Thanks so much for having me,

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.675
super excited to be on.

00:00:18.675 --> 00:00:21.735
So Multicoin Capital is a crypto fund.

00:00:21.735 --> 00:00:23.775
We're based in Austin, Texas.

00:00:23.775 --> 00:00:27.360
We spend all of our energy focused on the crypto space.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.460
We invest in protocols and in companies going all the way from

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.600
two guys or girls with

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.005
an idea all the way up through Bitcoin and everything in the middle.

00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:37.705
We go use derivative,

00:00:37.705 --> 00:00:38.840
we'll go long and short.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.650
We will invest in illiquid early stage projects and buy things on the public markets.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.270
Our investment mandate is to just invest in

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.760
the crypto ecosystem and invest in things that are crypto native.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.435
So although we follow the security token space,

00:00:53.435 --> 00:00:56.600
we don't like investing like if someone puts Apple stock on a blockchain,

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.540
we're not going to invest in that.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.620
But we spend all our time in crypto space and we think it's the coolest thing in

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.360
the world and we want to invest in some of

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.005
the most awesome protocols and companies building in this technology.

00:01:09.005 --> 00:01:15.220
So if you're at a party and someone asks you what is blockchain, what do you say to them?

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.345
I only go to parties where everyone already knows what blockchain is.

00:01:20.345 --> 00:01:23.480
Only the people who don't the know.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.370
I'm just playing.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.810
A blockchain is a ledger or

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.760
a database like any other database with the a couple of interesting differences.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.480
One is that the database is hosted by many people.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.260
So whereas like a typical database is hosted by one company or one person or is hosted

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.850
on one computer and controlled by that one person or that one entity,

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.720
a blockchain is stored on many computers and

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.875
no one person can just go randomly manipulate stuff in the database.

00:01:54.875 --> 00:01:57.005
The ledger is append only,

00:01:57.005 --> 00:01:58.715
so you can only add new entries to it.

00:01:58.715 --> 00:02:02.400
Once you've added something to it you cannot take anything back.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.850
I think in the case of Bitcoin,

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.890
there are something like 100,000 computers all over

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.365
the world today that are maintaining copy of this letter.

00:02:09.365 --> 00:02:13.190
So even if 50,000 of those computers blew up tomorrow,

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.980
the ledger is still totally intact.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.815
So it's a very simple definition of a blockchain.

00:02:18.815 --> 00:02:22.285
In addition to people asking what is blockchain,

00:02:22.285 --> 00:02:25.400
another common big question I get is,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.985
what is the big deal?

00:02:26.985 --> 00:02:31.415
Why are so many people and investors interested in blockchain generally?

00:02:31.415 --> 00:02:33.935
What are the traits that really are drawing people in?

00:02:33.935 --> 00:02:37.770
Yeah. I think in

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.620
the last 12 months it's been a little bit of people's eyes have woken up.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.140
It's like the price went up and that caused people to go take a second look.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.870
They pay attention.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.405
The core concepts is really fundamentally unchanged since Bitcoin launched in 2009,

00:02:52.405 --> 00:02:55.025
but there's some pretty powerful ideas here.

00:02:55.025 --> 00:02:58.250
The first is that you can have self sovereign money.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.730
So if you think about US dollars,

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.225
so you've got a green piece of paper you put in your wallet.

00:03:04.225 --> 00:03:06.600
It's more or less like your green piece of

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.560
paper and absent someone holding a gun to your head.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.515
It's your green piece of paper and no one can take it away from you.

00:03:12.515 --> 00:03:16.190
But as soon as you go from green pieces of paper in your wallet to

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.525
a digital bank account and you deposit that green piece of paper into an ATM,

00:03:20.525 --> 00:03:25.145
well, now you really are no longer sovereign in that like Bank of America just says,

00:03:25.145 --> 00:03:26.750
you can't withdraw money anymore,

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.955
then you can't withdraw anymore.

00:03:28.955 --> 00:03:32.600
If the IRS puts a freeze in your accounts, whatever.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.670
So once you go from physical cash to digital money in all governments,

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.170
in all countries around the world today,

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.995
you as the person who owns the money,

00:03:42.995 --> 00:03:45.140
or it's really no longer your money.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.660
It's now like you have a claim on the money

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.360
and Bank of America has the money and theoretically,

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.130
you have a claim on it and they will honor your claim,

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.210
but they have the money.

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:55.185
Right.

00:03:55.185 --> 00:03:57.845
That's a very subtle difference,

00:03:57.845 --> 00:04:00.530
but it has pretty profound implications on lots of things.

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.330
So you can't transfer money after 5:00 PM,

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.949
you can't transfer money on weekends,

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:06.960
bank holidays, exorbitant fees,

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.640
people can freeze your accounts.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.230
There's all kinds of weird second and third order effects

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.400
of the fact that you actually don't control your money.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.300
So one of the really profound breakthroughs of Bitcoin and really all

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:26.350
cryptocurrencies is that you as a consumer can be self sovereign and have money,

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.180
and literally no one in the world can take that away from you,

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.355
absent putting a gun to your head.

00:04:31.355 --> 00:04:33.320
You can travel across borders.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:40.490
You can travel anywhere and the system will work and it cannot be taken away from you.

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.980
That's a fundamentally unique thing.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.280
As people are opening their eyes to the power of

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.890
what that means for empowering consumers,

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.090
I think that's very, very profound impact on how the world's going to work.

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.960
Yeah, that makes sense to me. When I think of the US dollar

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.000
especially it's something that if you're

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.495
lucky where it feels like a fairly stable market.

00:05:05.495 --> 00:05:08.520
I don't have a lot of distressed in my bank, that kind of thing,

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.440
but I could definitely imagine perhaps elsewhere where stability or

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.070
even censorship of what you can

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.955
do with your money is an issue that this could be something really interesting.

00:05:19.955 --> 00:05:23.265
Along those lines, I'm wondering about blockchain.

00:05:23.265 --> 00:05:26.900
I see it's use in cryptocurrency and I'm also thinking it's much bigger than that.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:32.060
I'm wondering where you think it's going to impact the world.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.500
What industry do you see blockchain affecting now and maybe in future?

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.450
Yes. I think the single biggest use case for crypto and blockchains are

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:46.520
for what I would call creating a global digital reserve assets.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.140
So you can call it digital gold,

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:49.505
you can call it digital money,

00:05:49.505 --> 00:05:53.660
but something that it's a asset that no government can take away from you.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.970
They can't print new money of it and think

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.744
that that's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity.

00:05:58.744 --> 00:06:01.300
I think it's a huge opportunity.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.710
There's all kinds of other interesting use cases.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.890
So one of my favorites is this idea of digital assets.

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:12.275
So we invested in a protocol six-seven-eight months ago called Tari.

00:06:12.275 --> 00:06:15.050
They just came out of stealth mode maybe a month or two ago.

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.825
Tari is building a brand new blockchain that

00:06:17.825 --> 00:06:21.090
has two really strong features that are built at the core.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:27.110
One is privacy using this new technology called MimbleWimble, seriously.

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.370
MimbleWimble.

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.540
MimbleWimble. The second is they're building a super strong focus on digital assets.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:38.760
So they want people if they're at a venue for a concert it's just tickets.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.530
They want to be able to issue those on the Tari protocol and make it super easy.

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.690
If airline, you've got airline miles.

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.520
Starbucks you've got loyalty points.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.410
Well, there's all of these different businesses

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.400
that you can call them, they have a currency,

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.545
they have these either fungible or non fungible assets like tickets to a seat, whatever.

00:06:54.545 --> 00:06:57.110
All of these things today are managed in

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:00.800
these disparate proprietary databases and they're not fungible,

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.415
they're very hard to work with, they're all clunky.

00:07:03.415 --> 00:07:08.135
I think there's a really strong empowering concept of a consumer being able to say,

00:07:08.135 --> 00:07:09.680
no, here's my ticket,

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.880
I can see my claim.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.430
I'm going to see this [inaudible] concert next Tuesday,

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:18.720
whatever, and that a Ticketmaster has it no.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.945
I have my ticket. I can see that it's my ticket.

00:07:20.945 --> 00:07:22.205
If I choose this as my ticket,

00:07:22.205 --> 00:07:23.945
I can choose as my ticket,

00:07:23.945 --> 00:07:26.630
but it's not sitting on Ticketmaster's database.

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:29.405
That would apply for owning stock in a company.

00:07:29.405 --> 00:07:33.095
This would apply for any debt like anything.

00:07:33.095 --> 00:07:36.050
So I think this is a really profound concepts.

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:38.330
Today, all of these digital assets are all stored in

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.975
different databases but hosted by different companies all over the place,

00:07:40.975 --> 00:07:43.880
and there's no way to make sense of it in a unified way.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:49.160
So I'm really excited about the opportunity for digital assets on blockchains.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.845
Another thing I'm super excited about,

00:07:51.845 --> 00:07:55.440
there's a new protocol that launched recently called Auger.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.405
Auger are really, really cool concept,

00:07:58.405 --> 00:08:01.120
it is a global prediction market.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.150
So there's a few major categories of predictions.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:09.490
One would be predicting the price of a stock or some asset at some future point in time,

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:10.765
basically like an option.

00:08:10.765 --> 00:08:14.620
You can actually really broaden this to just be any form of derivative contract,

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.560
but another really common from a prediction markets would be sports betting.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.330
A third would be bidding on politics.

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:20.915
So your exists right now,.

00:08:20.915 --> 00:08:22.960
Auger launched on July ninth,

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.955
so just a few weeks ago.

00:08:24.955 --> 00:08:29.300
It is a prediction market where anyone can create a market for anything.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:32.760
The entire thing runs on Ethereum blockchain.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.795
No person in the world can stop the system.

00:08:36.795 --> 00:08:38.850
The entire Auger team could disappear

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:42.920
tomorrow off the planet earth and the system will keep running.

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:48.005
These extreme scenarios just to prove on the real business of something like this.

00:08:48.005 --> 00:08:50.140
It's pretty remarkable. So anyone,

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:51.715
anywhere in the world can create any market.

00:08:51.715 --> 00:08:56.950
Then anyone, anywhere in the world can come and bet on the outcomes of that market.

00:08:56.950 --> 00:09:01.820
So like you can submit any like yes-no question or something?

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:05.080
You can submit anything as long as if people want to come bet on it,

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.820
if they want to take odds and put bets on it,

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:09.010
then they can take odds and put bets on it.

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:11.650
Having to know, off the top your head,

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:14.135
what the most popular question is on there right now?

00:09:14.135 --> 00:09:16.100
So I think at the current moment,

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:19.535
the market with the highest large number of

00:09:19.535 --> 00:09:23.340
outstanding interest is the price of Ethereum at the end of the year,

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.900
I think it's at $500 at the end of the year,

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:27.625
I think that's the largest market.

00:09:27.625 --> 00:09:29.470
So the system is enough for two or three weeks,

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:31.880
I think they've created somewhere in the order of 900 markets.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.470
There's been about $2 million that's been bet through the system.

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:38.590
What so cool is the thing is entirely decentralized and peer-to-peer.

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:41.020
There is no central authority in the system.

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:42.970
If you think about a prediction market,

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:48.850
one of the hard problems is if you don't want a centralize person controlling the system.

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:50.695
Well, after the event is over,

00:09:50.695 --> 00:09:52.670
someone needs to flip a switch and say,

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:55.450
"Trump won" or "Hillary won" or the price of

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:58.360
ether was over 500 or less than 500 or whatever.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:02.015
If you want to be able to support any conceivable logic,

00:10:02.015 --> 00:10:05.275
then how do you do this in a decentralized way?

00:10:05.275 --> 00:10:09.790
Auger is a very clever solution where there are some fees in the system,

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:12.545
the fees are very low, but there are some fees.

00:10:12.545 --> 00:10:17.300
The idea is that once a prediction market is officially over,

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.360
people who own rep tokens,

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.770
rep tokens are the native token of the Auger network,

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:23.650
those people will be asked and they will say,

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:26.830
"Hey, this market is over.

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:30.605
Please vote and say what happened."

00:10:30.605 --> 00:10:32.830
Voting on the truth?

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:35.735
Voting on the truth, just say what happens.

00:10:35.735 --> 00:10:39.740
Who won the soccer game, who won the election, whatever.

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:44.045
In exchange for doing that, those people get a percentage of the fees.

00:10:44.045 --> 00:10:46.945
You might say, "Well, what's their motivation for telling the truth or lying?"

00:10:46.945 --> 00:10:53.079
So the idea is the system is that if you vote against the majority,

00:10:53.079 --> 00:10:56.285
let's say you said Hillary won the election.

00:10:56.285 --> 00:10:58.930
If you say that, then part of your Auger tokens,

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:00.425
instead of receiving part of those fees,

00:11:00.425 --> 00:11:03.805
your Auger tokens will be automatically burned and taken away from you.

00:11:03.805 --> 00:11:06.220
So the whole idea is, the whole system is intentionally

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:07.870
circular and that you should vote on

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:09.640
whatever you think everyone else is going to vote for.

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.315
The majority's are rules?

00:11:11.315 --> 00:11:15.520
Right. But everyone is likely going to vote the truth like,

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:16.865
how are you going to get,

00:11:16.865 --> 00:11:18.910
there's something like 100,000 or 200,000

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:21.100
people around the world who own Auger tokens today.

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:23.050
How are you going to all these people to collude and say,

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:24.650
"No, Hillary won the election."

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:26.965
That's not going to happen.

00:11:26.965 --> 00:11:29.190
Just maybe wishful thinking.

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:31.240
Wishful thinking perhaps or something.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.580
It's based on this idea of like,

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:38.210
you're never going to be able to get enough people to coordinate to lie about the truth.

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:40.900
So everyone will just honestly report the truth and they are incentivized to do

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.880
so because then they will receive some of the fees from the system.

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.365
Got it. That makes sense.

00:11:45.365 --> 00:11:46.865
You have a question,

00:11:46.865 --> 00:11:50.740
there's some odds in a typical betting way

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:54.680
and then people are incentivized to tell the truth at the end.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:57.160
I wonder though, if there are any scenarios

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.190
where the answer is ambiguous, what would happen?

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:06.190
The only thing that's coming to mind right now is celebrity relationships like,

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:09.405
did Brad and Angelina really break up or not?

00:12:09.405 --> 00:12:11.315
I guess you'd have to really define

00:12:11.315 --> 00:12:17.495
what if Page 6 of the times or something reports is that?

00:12:17.495 --> 00:12:19.565
Some truth or something like that,

00:12:19.565 --> 00:12:21.845
I wonder if they would ever be a divide like that?

00:12:21.845 --> 00:12:25.000
I suspect that market would probably not garner too much betting at this.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.080
It's not yet.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.690
Also the problem especially with markets like that

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:34.960
is Brad and whoever are incentivized to collude.

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.720
It's like the boxer throwing a match,

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:42.430
it's just very easy to screw with that.

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:44.365
So I suspect there wouldn't be much betting interest.

00:12:44.365 --> 00:12:45.700
There is a mechanism in

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:48.250
the Auger system for people

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:51.120
who owned the rep tokens who have to ultimately report on the truth.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.620
There is a way for them to say this market is invalid.

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:54.310
Okay.

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:57.325
So one of the core tenets of Auger is,

00:12:57.325 --> 00:12:59.360
you can't stop anyone from creating market.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:06.180
Like for example, assassination markets have come up already which is obviously it's bad,

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:08.090
we don't want this.

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:09.870
You can't stop people from doing it.

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:13.150
So the way that the system is designed to accommodate

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:17.270
this is the rep holders can just say, "This is invalid."

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:19.660
In which case, even if people bet on it,

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:21.995
the system will not resolve and everyone will

00:13:21.995 --> 00:13:24.355
just get their money back on whatever they put in.

00:13:24.355 --> 00:13:26.979
That makes sense, I think that's a really interesting application.

00:13:26.979 --> 00:13:28.640
I also wanted to ask you,

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:33.235
as reading a couple of the posts on multi coins like blog,

00:13:33.235 --> 00:13:36.085
you had written something about Web 3.0.

00:13:36.085 --> 00:13:39.340
Web 1.0 being this dial-up AILA Messenger,

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:42.245
Web 2.0 being the current state,

00:13:42.245 --> 00:13:45.160
like our data is just out there.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:49.450
I was wondering if you could talk about Web 3.0 and how a blockchain might

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:53.350
be used in like a newish version of the Web?

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:57.620
So as you say, Web 1.0 was like Mosaic,

00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.500
Netscape, all that stuff.

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:00.830
Netscape.

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:03.520
The 90's basically of the internet.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:07.510
It was clunky, it theoretically works, but not really.

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:10.060
Web 2 can started around '03,

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:11.480
'04 maybe, time frame.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.895
We started getting consumer SAS,

00:14:13.895 --> 00:14:16.375
online services that were pretty good.

00:14:16.375 --> 00:14:18.845
Today we have super mature, sexy,

00:14:18.845 --> 00:14:22.010
amazing, beautiful applications that can do all the range of things.

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:25.690
The big problem with the Web 2 model that we live in right now is that,

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:29.300
the companies provide it to these services control the data.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:30.670
When you use Google,

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:33.095
when you use Facebook when you use Twitter, when you use whatever.

00:14:33.095 --> 00:14:36.890
Snapchat, which by the way, they keep your pictures on their servers for awhile.

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:38.650
Like delete them after some number of months,

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:41.710
but it's not five minutes.

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:46.235
So all of these systems we all use every day now,

00:14:46.235 --> 00:14:50.305
like these companies have all the control on all the power of all the stuff.

00:14:50.305 --> 00:14:53.780
It's fundamentally all the data is like the consumer's data.

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:55.600
It's my health data, it's my searching,

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.505
it's my friends, it's my pictures.

00:14:57.505 --> 00:14:59.650
It's not Facebook pictures, it's my pictures.

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:01.510
It's like anything you've ever put out there.

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:05.965
Literally correct. That's the current state of Web 2.

00:15:05.965 --> 00:15:09.790
The Web 3 vision is really about empowering consumers to be self sovereign,

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:12.535
so that consumers can control it on own their own data,

00:15:12.535 --> 00:15:14.230
but still be able to have these dynamic,

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:17.750
rich applications of things that consumers have come to expect of the internet.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.500
So that's like the grand vision of Web 3.

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:21.790
This means self sovereign money,

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:23.345
self sovereign data, self sovereign identity,

00:15:23.345 --> 00:15:28.330
self sovereign all of these things, privacy, online privacy.

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:31.610
So it's kind of division. Then on a technical basis,

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:34.715
we're just in the process of building out the early parts of

00:15:34.715 --> 00:15:38.305
the technology stack to make all of this possible.

00:15:38.305 --> 00:15:40.870
So just like right in the '90s,

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:46.750
we needed TCP/IP and then we needed HTTP and a whole host dependent.

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:48.755
Then we got HTML and we got JavaScript.

00:15:48.755 --> 00:15:53.790
These all kind of basic building blocks coming together to make a browser thing work.

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:57.005
Then 2000s we had the LAMP stack,

00:15:57.005 --> 00:16:00.805
which is old now decrepid web stack to build a web server.

00:16:00.805 --> 00:16:04.630
Today, we've got this full range of AWS servers and Google Cloud Servers.

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:06.640
We now have this new serverless movement,

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:08.380
it's called Lambda, It's cool.

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:11.830
Anyways, the whole stack,

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:15.435
that's been maturing for a long time and people have an iterating and building on it.

00:16:15.435 --> 00:16:20.825
So we're right now in the early phases of this Web 3 stack which is all about

00:16:20.825 --> 00:16:24.110
putting the people at the end points in

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:27.790
control and not having a single thing in the middle that controls everything.

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:28.975
Right.

00:16:28.975 --> 00:16:31.735
We're still in the early phases of building that infrastructure.

00:16:31.735 --> 00:16:33.370
So when I talk about the web three stack,

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:34.600
what I'm really referring to is

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:37.719
the entire software stack from the core Internet protocol,

00:16:37.719 --> 00:16:40.405
all the way up to the end-user experience,

00:16:40.405 --> 00:16:43.960
enabling all of this to come to fruition.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:47.980
I've also heard blockchain tech like compared to the dot-com bubble.

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:50.260
You have your Amazons, your Googles,

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:51.940
you also have cats.com,

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:53.965
and live journal or whatever.

00:16:53.965 --> 00:16:57.910
As an investor, how do you look at all these options?

00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:01.630
Things like [inaudible] or specific kind of coin,

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:05.290
so separate the winners from the losers.

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:07.510
Are there a few specific traits that you look for?

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:11.755
Or is it a bit of an educated guess?

00:17:11.755 --> 00:17:14.920
It's all definitely educated guesses for sure.

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:15.550
Yeah.

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:16.690
The framework what we're looking at,

00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:18.805
we have different frameworks we use.

00:17:18.805 --> 00:17:21.820
So if we're looking at what we call layer one protocol.

00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:23.350
So Bitcoin is a layer one protocol,

00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:24.955
[inaudible] is layer protocol.

00:17:24.955 --> 00:17:27.655
Really anything that has to solve consensus,

00:17:27.655 --> 00:17:29.740
we considered a layer one protocol.

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:33.100
If we're looking at those, there's a certain number of things we look for.

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:36.220
So I talk about this and make my post called the Web 3 stack.

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:38.380
There's a whole bunch of teams that have come out

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:40.630
with new ideas for consensus algorithms.

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:44.725
That consensus is really like the base layer of the entire Web 3 stack.

00:17:44.725 --> 00:17:48.025
It's really the foundation on top of which are almost everything else was being built.

00:17:48.025 --> 00:17:53.605
Consensus is the process by which something is determined about transaction or not.

00:17:53.605 --> 00:17:57.910
So the idea of determining is this transaction valid or not is a separate question.

00:17:57.910 --> 00:17:59.530
From then, the next question is,

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:01.030
given there's all these people in the world who are

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:02.410
submitting transactions as you need to come to

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:05.965
some ordering of which transactions happen, first, second, third.

00:18:05.965 --> 00:18:09.400
So consensus is really a more about coming to order,

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.635
given a set of valid transactions,

00:18:11.635 --> 00:18:13.060
in what order they come into.

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:13.750
Okay.

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:16.420
Get network latency nodes around the world, etc.

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:17.620
Like chronological ordering.

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:20.920
Yes, correct. When we're looking at a layer one protocol,

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:23.740
for example, the question we're really asking ourselves is,

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:25.450
how is this going to be the theorem?

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:28.060
If you're going to claim to make a run at a theory and have us

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:31.420
new smart contract platform with like features X and Y, and Z or whatever.

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:32.710
Like X and Y, and Z,

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:34.840
you need to probably be pretty compelling.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.270
A theorem has a large head start, has a lot of mine share it,

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:40.075
has a good note, there's a lot of people building up a theorem.

00:18:40.075 --> 00:18:43.705
The Tallic and the Ethereum Foundation have done a really excellent job

00:18:43.705 --> 00:18:48.550
of being relatively impartial as they think they can be.

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:50.875
Promoting an open ecosystem.

00:18:50.875 --> 00:18:52.330
They're not stepping on people's toes.

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:54.670
They're not building things that other developers want to build on,

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:56.635
and they're just focusing on the core protocol.

00:18:56.635 --> 00:19:01.345
Like their focus has enabled built this really strong community around them.

00:19:01.345 --> 00:19:02.770
So if you're going to say, hey,

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:05.770
we've got these ideas that can perhaps be better than Ethereum,

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:09.310
they need to be really much better and they need to be

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:13.240
things that Ethereum is going to have too much baggage to be able to pull it off.

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:16.810
There are good ideas out there that Ethereum we'll get to in the next 12 months.

00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:19.210
So if you're telling me, "Well, that's the basis for a new chain,

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:21.250
then that just some very interesting."

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:24.385
There are some things that Ethereum just cannot easily do.

00:19:24.385 --> 00:19:26.485
Because it's already out there ,

00:19:26.485 --> 00:19:28.870
people using it and so they have a lot of baggage right there,

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:30.415
just slower to move.

00:19:30.415 --> 00:19:32.980
So we will look for like

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:37.090
really deep insights about things at Ethereum cannot fundamentally accomplish.

00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:39.970
Then if that's in fact true,

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:42.895
then can it deliver something that's 10 or a 100 X better.

00:19:42.895 --> 00:19:45.445
So that's at the base layer.

00:19:45.445 --> 00:19:47.725
Then there's a next layer that we look at.

00:19:47.725 --> 00:19:50.530
We call these in Web 3 stack post,

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:53.110
call them optional components of building in Web 3 stacks.

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:56.350
So for example, if you need to store just file somewhere.

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:58.270
You don't really want to store files in Ethereum blockchain,

00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:01.465
so you probably want to store them in something like IPFS,

00:20:01.465 --> 00:20:04.135
which is interplanetary file system.

00:20:04.135 --> 00:20:07.450
If you want to do video streaming like Ethereum knows you're not

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:10.420
going to stream like transcript video and push video.

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:11.605
So there's, for example,

00:20:11.605 --> 00:20:15.460
a group alive here that's building a de-centralized video trans-coding service.

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:18.520
There's another group called the graph,

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:22.060
which if you need to do high-performance queries on the blockchain,

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:23.695
we get Ethereum nodes,

00:20:23.695 --> 00:20:25.150
gets imperative, for example,

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:28.900
really aren't designed to enable production scale,

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:31.525
numbers of queries on the core database.

00:20:31.525 --> 00:20:33.880
So there's a group called the graph that's building

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:37.540
out a way to do decentralized queries at scale.

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:40.600
So there's all these kind of, I call the middleware components of things.

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:42.999
That if you're building some sort of end-user application,

00:20:42.999 --> 00:20:45.670
you may want some of these pieces.

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:48.700
All those pieces of the stack are also currently being built out.

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:51.310
So when we evaluate those pieces of the stack,

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:53.905
we're really try to understand as, how big is the market?

00:20:53.905 --> 00:20:57.625
Are people going to use this? What kind of adapt may or may not need this?

00:20:57.625 --> 00:20:59.470
I go on from there.

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:04.120
Then the highest level of stack are basically we call DAPs or end-user applications.

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:07.480
These obviously, they have a UI. People clicked buttons on them and they do stuff.

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:12.475
That feels a lot more traditional venture investing when we're investing at that layer.

00:21:12.475 --> 00:21:15.670
So it's like there's a variety of things out there and they're

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:18.700
all optimizing for these different use cases,

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:21.235
whether it's like speed or scalability.

00:21:21.235 --> 00:21:24.985
That's actually interesting because I was thinking about

00:21:24.985 --> 00:21:31.280
cryptocurrency and I was thinking about it as like money.

00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:34.990
Like the value of the community is not to be underestimated.

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:37.330
Where if people are excited about something,

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:38.515
devoted to it and using it,

00:21:38.515 --> 00:21:42.340
that can guarantee you something success.

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:45.090
Like, I spend my time working to get

00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:48.120
money so I can do other things because I know other people value it.

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.490
But it is interesting to think about how there might

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:55.020
be similar apps in that they use blockchain,

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:59.110
but have optimized for different capabilities like

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:04.029
speed or decentralization that could be useful in multiple places.

00:22:04.029 --> 00:22:08.035
It's really good to get your extra insight into this I think.

00:22:08.035 --> 00:22:11.410
I was wondering if you have advice for people who

00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:15.415
are [inaudible] to enter the space and learn more about blockchain.

00:22:15.415 --> 00:22:19.000
I think if you're developer or really good place to get started,

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.340
I think ConsenSys, they have

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:24.490
a lot of great materials on learning how to develop for Ethereum.

00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:26.230
Then, same for the other chain.

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:29.755
So things like EOS, things like Tezos,

00:22:29.755 --> 00:22:32.740
all the the core team is building the primary chains have

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:36.415
pretty robust documentation for getting starting building there.

00:22:36.415 --> 00:22:38.560
If you don't want to just jump straight in the building and you

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.095
just learn your way around the ecosystem,

00:22:41.095 --> 00:22:43.705
there is a few really good resources online.

00:22:43.705 --> 00:22:47.410
I think you can get a turn to, to just start to get a feel of what's going on.

00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:52.375
So probably, my favorite publication is a weekly publication called Token Economy.

00:22:52.375 --> 00:22:54.190
They published once a week every Sunday,

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:57.400
it's tokeneconomy.co, it's a website.

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.290
They published the week,

00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:00.730
they summarized the news for the week.

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:05.590
They provide commentary on it and they highlight good insights from developers,

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:07.780
from entrepreneurs, from investors,

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:09.940
all over the ecosystem.

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:11.500
Really, really good weekly summary.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:13.330
I look forward to it every single week.

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:17.830
Not my probably favorite like news source on a daily basis is called

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:22.300
trustnodes.com or.org called Trustnodes. It's excellent.

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:25.360
If you want something that feels more like TechCrunch for crypto, like CoinDesk,

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:29.450
does a good job of being TechCrunch or Crypto.

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:32.650
Then I curate a couple of Twitter lists.

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:35.455
So if you go to my Twitter profile and go to the list section,

00:23:35.455 --> 00:23:37.810
I curate, I call it a VIP list,

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:39.085
that's about 60 people.

00:23:39.085 --> 00:23:42.055
Then I curated just a more generalist, it's like 600 people.

00:23:42.055 --> 00:23:46.405
So depending on what level of noise you want in your Twitter browsing experience.

00:23:46.405 --> 00:23:46.915
Yeah.

00:23:46.915 --> 00:23:50.005
I will say a lot of the dialogue and action happens on Twitter.

00:23:50.005 --> 00:23:53.530
I do like Twitter. I think it's probably similar for the AI spaces,

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:57.730
like this thought leaders that you can get up-to-date news.

00:23:57.730 --> 00:24:00.970
But I guess the trouble is if you're not on there all the time,

00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:03.100
which you probably shouldn't be on Twitter all the time,

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:04.975
you're maybe going to miss something.

00:24:04.975 --> 00:24:06.520
But I like that as a resource.

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:08.800
Are you finding these things like through word of mouth

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:11.290
or just creating things on your own?

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:15.730
I mean, I've been in the crypto space now for a little over two years personally,

00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:18.200
and then professionally for about a year.

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:20.500
This is all just like,

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.330
I just read stuff and I click links and

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:25.150
those links go all places and write recommendations from friends.

00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:26.975
This is all pretty like,

00:24:26.975 --> 00:24:28.605
there's no hard science on this.

00:24:28.605 --> 00:24:34.550
I've looked at lots of stuff and I have developed my curated information feed.

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:36.685
I did get started CoinDesk,

00:24:36.685 --> 00:24:38.020
Trustnodes, and took an economy,

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:40.765
and then those lists on Twitter will get you kick-started,

00:24:40.765 --> 00:24:44.035
and then from there you can create your own Twitter lists and go from there.

00:24:44.035 --> 00:24:47.245
Yeah, I'd also be really miss if I didn't mention that Udacity is coming out with

00:24:47.245 --> 00:24:51.070
a Blockchain of urban nanodegree just to follow this knowledge gap.

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:52.930
But of course, we encourage people using

00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:56.995
as many resources as they can get their hands on.

00:24:56.995 --> 00:25:01.660
I think part of why we're making this and asking about

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:06.970
these resources is we value this firsthand experience.

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:09.220
If you are wanting to be a developer,

00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:13.660
can you actually code some JavaScript or whatever to

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:19.510
learn more about validation and signing or some details about cryptography?

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:23.290
I wonder with respect to the firsthand experience,

00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:29.995
if you ever recommend that people buy Bitcoin or Ether and invest?

00:25:29.995 --> 00:25:33.260
If you have the means, would you say, "Go,

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:38.400
have fun with this thing," or is it for serious players only? I guess is my question.

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:39.945
I think everyone should own some crypto.

00:25:39.945 --> 00:25:41.535
I'm super biased.

00:25:41.535 --> 00:25:45.570
I am not so favorite of this kind of everything I'm saying.

00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:47.610
I drank the Kool-Aid a long time ago.

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:50.230
I think this stuff is going to change the world.

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.230
If that is correct,

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:55.060
then you will have a lot more money in

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:58.345
the future than you have now if you buy some Bitcoin and some Ether.

00:25:58.345 --> 00:26:00.910
For passive investors, if you're like,

00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:03.430
"Look, I'm not going to go deep into all this stuff,

00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:06.880
but I want some exposure," then go to coinbase.com,

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:09.340
buy some Bitcoin, buy some Ether and let it sit.

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:11.200
You don't need to trade it. You don't need to check prices.

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.795
You don't need to read the news. Check in once a year.

00:26:13.795 --> 00:26:17.605
That's fine. If you want to get more into it, that's great.

00:26:17.605 --> 00:26:18.835
The rabbit hole never ends.

00:26:18.835 --> 00:26:22.555
Yeah, I think that is what's exciting about it though.

00:26:22.555 --> 00:26:26.890
I have heard that when asked about Bitcoin or Ethereum,

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:28.750
that you're on team Ethereum.

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:32.470
I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your reasoning behind that,

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:34.570
or am I correct or no?

00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:37.960
I definitely have a bias for Ethereum over Bitcoin.

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:40.270
I will say over the last quarter or so,

00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:42.550
I've come around more to the Bitcoin view,

00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:45.760
but still if you tell me to pick one today, I'll pick Ethereum.

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:48.670
My basic reasoning is that, a,

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:52.395
I got into crypto because I like building cool software.

00:26:52.395 --> 00:26:54.285
I've been an engineer since I was a kid,

00:26:54.285 --> 00:26:58.245
started a tech company right out of college. I like building stuff.

00:26:58.245 --> 00:26:59.910
I like seeing other people build stuff.

00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:02.975
The Bitcoin community is the antithesis of building things.

00:27:02.975 --> 00:27:05.575
They really just like to yell at each other on Twitter.

00:27:05.575 --> 00:27:07.240
They want to stay still.

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:10.390
Yes. The whole point of Bitcoin is that it does not change.

00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:15.280
My inner build cool stuff per person doesn't care for that.

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:19.540
I have a natural affinity towards Ethereum for that purpose.

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:22.510
The other reason I think more practically is,

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:25.540
there's two fundamental competing hypotheses on,

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:29.455
how do you get this global digital reserve asset that's worth many trillions of dollars?

00:27:29.455 --> 00:27:32.215
There's three fundamental hypotheses on this.

00:27:32.215 --> 00:27:34.375
I've written about them in a blog on my personal website.

00:27:34.375 --> 00:27:36.625
It's called Paths To Tens Of Trillions,

00:27:36.625 --> 00:27:39.175
and I lay out these hypotheses.

00:27:39.175 --> 00:27:42.520
One hypothesis is basically the store of value hypothesis.

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:45.130
It just says, "Look, guarantee there's a fixed supply,

00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:46.810
guarantee that it's self sovereign,

00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:50.170
guarantee that the system doesn't break," and that's about it.

00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:52.150
As long as you have those checkboxes checked,

00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:53.620
people will realize governments are evil

00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:55.300
because they print money and they will therefore buy this thing

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:59.080
that governments cannot inflate and that will make it at the global store value.

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:02.635
That's one worldview that's pretty much the Bitcoin view of the world.

00:28:02.635 --> 00:28:04.660
The next view of the world is, no,

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:06.550
if you're going to get people to value this thing as money,

00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:07.825
they need to use it as money.

00:28:07.825 --> 00:28:09.805
They need to use it for commerce.

00:28:09.805 --> 00:28:12.940
This is the idea of the utility hypothesis.

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:14.950
Ethereum and really all of these smart contract platforms

00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:16.225
are going to fall into this camp.

00:28:16.225 --> 00:28:18.550
They're saying, "Look, you can do these traceless forms of

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:21.520
commerce and enable people to buy x and y and z."

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:24.115
If you're going to get this thing that be money,

00:28:24.115 --> 00:28:25.825
people need to use it as money.

00:28:25.825 --> 00:28:27.865
Those two views of the world,

00:28:27.865 --> 00:28:33.205
although they have the same general end the state of it's the thing worth a lot of money,

00:28:33.205 --> 00:28:35.755
the means by which they got there are very different.

00:28:35.755 --> 00:28:39.445
So I tend to believe the latter more than the former.

00:28:39.445 --> 00:28:43.285
Yeah. I think I've heard them compared to Bitcoin as the gold.

00:28:43.285 --> 00:28:47.525
There's a limited amount of it and it's just is what it is.

00:28:47.525 --> 00:28:51.870
Something like Ethereum being compared to money as a means of exchange,

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:56.160
which I actually think it's a little more Silicon Valley. It's a little more exciting.

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:59.085
Some things like you can build on top of it with, I think.

00:28:59.085 --> 00:29:02.800
Also in some ways, it feels a little more familiar.

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:07.420
So with something that is relatively new and exciting,

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:13.030
there's a lot of misinformation floating around or very sensational headlines.

00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:14.230
So I wanted to do

00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:16.530
this myth-busting session where

00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:18.990
I say something and maybe you can respond to it and tell me,

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:21.030
is it myth, is it fact,

00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:22.830
or is it a mix of both?

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:28.175
The first one is that Blockchain is a fad, that it won't last.

00:29:28.175 --> 00:29:30.865
That's laughable.

00:29:30.865 --> 00:29:36.220
The reason being it's proven itself at this point. Would you say?

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:38.780
I think so.

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:42.685
One of my favorite lessons from history is

00:29:42.685 --> 00:29:46.420
the intolerant minority usually wins, which is counter-intuitive.

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:52.210
Normally, you would just think the majority wins just in general, in an abstract sense,

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:54.055
whereas what's typically happening is that there is

00:29:54.055 --> 00:29:58.675
a apathetic majority in most things. They don't care.

00:29:58.675 --> 00:29:59.560
They're passive.

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:03.205
They're passive. They just don't care even if they all concur on whatever the issue is.

00:30:03.205 --> 00:30:06.130
There's some intolerant minority that yells and screams and will

00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:09.115
fight and whatever and they are the ones who pushed things forward.

00:30:09.115 --> 00:30:11.380
This is true for all civil rights.

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:17.275
This is true for a 100 of examples in history of how this is played out.

00:30:17.275 --> 00:30:19.285
So when I look at crypto today,

00:30:19.285 --> 00:30:24.325
what I realize is you see is there's very intolerant minority where they're saying,

00:30:24.325 --> 00:30:27.580
"No, governments are evil, stop printing money.

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:29.260
We want self sovereignty with control.

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:30.550
They want control of our own data.

00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:32.860
We don't want these corporations to have our data."

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:34.780
They are the intolerant minority today,

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:37.460
and those are the die-hards in crypto.

00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:39.970
They are not going away.

00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:43.640
They are intolerant and they will stay intolerant.

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:46.750
Their web-free stack is being built out.

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:51.580
It's still hard to mentally reorient your mind around the implications of this,

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:53.680
but as this stack gets more mature,

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:55.090
as it becomes more usable,

00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:58.060
I expect that people's eyes will open up and say,

00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:00.175
"Holy cow, the world can be different."

00:31:00.175 --> 00:31:05.275
My favorite practical, modern example of this is when I was a kid,

00:31:05.275 --> 00:31:07.675
the two rules of being a kid were,

00:31:07.675 --> 00:31:10.870
don't get in the car with strangers and don't talk to strangers.

00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:15.160
Sorry, don't meet people on the Internet and don't get in a car with strangers.

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:16.885
It sounds familiar.

00:31:16.885 --> 00:31:20.050
Today, I call people on the Internet and get in their car.

00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:22.015
True. Correctly.

00:31:22.015 --> 00:31:24.880
So my point is, in my lifetime,

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:27.880
[inaudible] the two cardinal rules of being a kid,

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:29.515
it's like I did this every day,

00:31:29.515 --> 00:31:33.745
and I know lots of parents who send their kids in an Uber, all the time.

00:31:33.745 --> 00:31:39.700
So there's just a lot of fundamental beliefs that can be reoriented.

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:42.580
It just takes a little bit of time to click.

00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:45.700
Yeah. Like a passive majority that's a little skeptical,

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:47.575
but mostly it is just passive.

00:31:47.575 --> 00:31:52.585
Then this passionate minority that will grow as these applications reveal themselves.

00:31:52.585 --> 00:31:56.005
I think that is pretty true.

00:31:56.005 --> 00:31:58.780
So the second myth slash,

00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:01.195
perhaps fact, is that blockchain can't scale.

00:32:01.195 --> 00:32:06.970
That it's too slow at doing transactions to be reaching a global scale.

00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:08.860
So this is definitely a major challenge today.

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:12.700
It's the single largest technical challenge facing blockchains today.

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:15.160
Just about all of the smartest people in crypto

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:17.350
today are working feverishly on this problem.

00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:20.785
I expect we will have viable solutions in the next few years.

00:32:20.785 --> 00:32:23.965
Is there anything promising that comes to mind?

00:32:23.965 --> 00:32:28.795
So there's six fundamental ways to scale a blockchain.

00:32:28.795 --> 00:32:32.275
So one is you can have many smaller chains.

00:32:32.275 --> 00:32:34.180
Two is you can have really big blocks.

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:37.180
Three is you can compress data on the chain.

00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:39.505
Four is you can have [inaudible] layer 2,

00:32:39.505 --> 00:32:43.525
like lightning work in Bitcoin or plasma in Ethereum are examples.

00:32:43.525 --> 00:32:48.805
Five is charting, and six is [inaudible] improvements and consensus.

00:32:48.805 --> 00:32:52.120
Those are really the only fundamental ways you can do it.

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:56.270
There are super smart people working on each of the six.

00:32:56.670 --> 00:32:59.260
Although on an individual basis,

00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:00.400
maybe you disagree with one,

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.110
or even multiple of those, ideologically,

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:05.080
which there are some ideological reasons to oppose some of those concepts.

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:07.300
As all six people make progress on all six of these things,

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:09.010
it's getting better, faster, at the same time,

00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:11.830
you have this compounding effect that most people,

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:13.270
linearly, they're like "No,

00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:14.695
it's not going to get you there."

00:33:14.695 --> 00:33:16.570
But if you actually compound them all together you can get

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:19.825
some very compelling improvements at the end.

00:33:19.825 --> 00:33:21.505
Yeah. That does make sense to me.

00:33:21.505 --> 00:33:24.955
Third, last one, blockchain will revolutionize the world.

00:33:24.955 --> 00:33:27.670
I think it's sensational but perhaps

00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:31.630
it's an exaggeration or just something that time will tell.

00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:33.220
I really hate the word revolutionize.

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:34.060
Yes. Perhaps that's it.

00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:38.170
I don't think that the word revolutionize is actually a word, maybe it is.

00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:41.380
If I see it in a pitch deck now, I stop reading.

00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:42.400
That's fair.

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:46.615
So I've discounted it as no longer a word in the English language.

00:33:46.615 --> 00:33:49.840
I think it's going to change the world,

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:51.340
both in terms of money and governments,

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:54.220
and as well as technology stacks [inaudible] people,

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:56.395
and self sovereignty, and data, and privacy.

00:33:56.395 --> 00:33:59.245
I believe very strongly that those things will happen.

00:33:59.245 --> 00:34:00.565
We're still super early,

00:34:00.565 --> 00:34:05.290
but once you've seen the demo,

00:34:05.290 --> 00:34:06.520
there's not even a sexy demo,

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:11.020
but once it clicks for you how the status quo works,

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:12.700
and how this works,

00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:15.590
and you're like this is going to happen.

00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:18.400
You can't keep this in a bottle forever.

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:24.355
Yeah. I also recoil from the idea of something being revolutionary.

00:34:24.355 --> 00:34:25.690
I can almost imagine,

00:34:25.690 --> 00:34:29.080
as someone who is almost at this passive majority level,

00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:34.465
if tomorrow Amazon switched to using blockchain and they didn't tell me,

00:34:34.465 --> 00:34:37.015
I probably would not even notice and it would have

00:34:37.015 --> 00:34:39.985
changed how these transactions are working.

00:34:39.985 --> 00:34:42.595
Well, that's the thing. Blockchain, you'll never see it.

00:34:42.595 --> 00:34:44.755
By definition it's virtual.

00:34:44.755 --> 00:34:47.560
You'll have the UI for all of your favorite apps,

00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:50.455
will still be some pretty UI, whatever on your iPhone.

00:34:50.455 --> 00:34:52.630
The back end will be different and it'll be subtle,

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:55.795
but the reason some fundamental things are the way they are,

00:34:55.795 --> 00:34:59.665
will change to ultimately be better for consumers.

00:34:59.665 --> 00:35:02.755
Yes. So I wanted to ask, as an investor,

00:35:02.755 --> 00:35:07.195
if it's difficult investing in technology that is open source.

00:35:07.195 --> 00:35:13.075
Like right now I can go on GitHub and look at the core of Bitcoin protocol and,

00:35:13.075 --> 00:35:18.820
maybe, fork it and create a copy of my own and start my own cryptocurrency, or something.

00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:21.880
So does that make it difficult to invest in this technology?

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:26.650
Are you looking at different aspects of how people use this?

00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:29.950
It's actually a real big challenge of investing in crypto,

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:32.320
is that basically everything is open source.

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:37.180
That means competitive barriers to entry is very different.

00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:41.590
Really the only mode in crypto is network effects.

00:35:41.590 --> 00:35:46.645
If whatever the protocol is you're building cannot accrue network effects,

00:35:46.645 --> 00:35:51.490
then it's going to be very hard for it to be meaningfully differentiated in the long run.

00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:55.465
By network effects, this is a term that's thrown out there quite a bit.

00:35:55.465 --> 00:35:57.640
It's a little bit misunderstood,

00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:00.295
but the basic idea of network effects is as

00:36:00.295 --> 00:36:03.130
an additional user uses the network or the service,

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:06.325
the value for existing users increases.

00:36:06.325 --> 00:36:08.860
So I actually wrote a blog post back in May,

00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:11.800
I think it's called On the Network Effects of Stores of Value,

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:15.670
explaining some of these core concepts about different kinds of network effects,

00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:16.960
how to think about the strengths of

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:20.680
relative network effects and explore some of these concepts.

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:25.960
But yeah, when we invest an absolute key thing we look for is, if the thing works,

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:29.170
as new users use the thing does it get better for

00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:33.920
existing users?We'll have an understanding of the nuances of how that will work.

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:38.940
That's interesting because I think about these earlier cryptocurrencies,

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:41.940
and maybe the reason why they're so popular is because they got

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:45.870
a head start on who is using them in the first place.

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:48.245
My last question is,

00:36:48.245 --> 00:36:53.800
if there are people in your life who you're surprised are getting into crypto?

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:56.110
In my life, personally,

00:36:56.110 --> 00:36:58.420
my mom owns some Bitcoin.

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:03.920
My mom is far closer to Luddite than technologists.

00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:08.030
She's got some Bitcoin, she's got some Ether.

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:11.785
Who else in my personal life?

00:37:11.785 --> 00:37:13.600
I have family in Iran,

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:16.390
and my family's Iranian.

00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:18.700
About half of my family is in the US now,

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:20.680
and about half is still in Iran.

00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:23.395
Actually, just in the last few weeks,

00:37:23.395 --> 00:37:26.919
Trump reinstated sanctions on Iran,

00:37:26.919 --> 00:37:28.540
the economy's tanked there.

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:32.080
People were expecting the sanctions to be removed eventually and they're back,

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:34.360
and so people are quite unhappy.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:36.595
There's been a lot of protesters out in the street,

00:37:36.595 --> 00:37:40.090
and a lot of my family there is trying to figure out how to get money out of the country.

00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:42.370
So actually, it's very personal.

00:37:42.370 --> 00:37:45.340
So I've got family that's using crypto-

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:46.270
It makes a lot of sense.

00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:47.095
-to get money out.

00:37:47.095 --> 00:37:49.495
I think those are all really interesting use cases,

00:37:49.495 --> 00:37:53.305
and there is a little bit of a barrier of skepticism,

00:37:53.305 --> 00:37:55.930
but sometimes it just takes one person that you

00:37:55.930 --> 00:37:59.110
trust to suggest it to you to get you over that hump.

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:05.275
So thank you for joining us and spending some time with interesting conversation.

00:38:05.275 --> 00:38:07.510
We're both on Twitter, so I was wondering if you wanted to shout

00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:10.300
out your handle, or anything else.

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:13.340
Yeah. I'm a super colorful character on Twitter.

00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:16.150
My Twitter handle is just my name,

00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:20.140
so @kylesamani, K-Y-L-E S-A-M-A-N-I.

00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:23.335
Okay. Thank you to everyone who joined us,

00:38:23.335 --> 00:38:25.795
and we'll see you on the Internet.

00:38:25.795 --> 00:38:27.650
Bye.
