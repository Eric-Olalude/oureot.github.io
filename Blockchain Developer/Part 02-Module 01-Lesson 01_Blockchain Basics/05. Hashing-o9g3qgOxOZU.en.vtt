00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.464
Now, you have some background on the goals and motivations of the blockchain.

00:00:04.464 --> 00:00:07.679
Next, let's walk through how this is translated into

00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:11.339
the actual components that have been built to make the system work.

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:15.189
These components are what's represented here in the blockchain framework.

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:17.850
We won't cover them in the exact order that listed here,

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.200
that order has more to do with how the system works together,

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.144
which we'll cover more once we've defined all the pieces.

00:00:24.144 --> 00:00:26.269
Instead, we'll start with what we think are

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:30.445
the most fundamental pieces then work up to the more complex components.

00:00:30.445 --> 00:00:34.090
With that said, we'll start this video with the topic of hashing.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.280
In this video, we'll discuss hashing and the details of

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.695
a specific hashing function, SHA256.

00:00:40.695 --> 00:00:43.945
A hash is a digital fingerprint for information.

00:00:43.945 --> 00:00:48.375
It's a unique string of letters and numbers that represent a set of data.

00:00:48.375 --> 00:00:49.859
To get a hash value,

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:53.865
you start with a bit of data and pass it through a hashing function.

00:00:53.865 --> 00:00:58.605
The hashing function maps a group of that data to a unique hash value.

00:00:58.604 --> 00:01:03.239
It will take in the information you give it and create a completely unique hash value.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.344
This hash value now acts as a unique identifier for the original data.

00:01:08.344 --> 00:01:10.939
This allows you to identify a given set of data

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:13.780
much more easily by referencing its hash value.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.129
SHA256 is a specific hashing function.

00:01:17.129 --> 00:01:24.069
SHA stands for Secure Hashing Algorithm and 256 represents the output of the algorithm.

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:27.319
In this case, it tells us that the number you'll get back as

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:30.444
a hash value is a 256 bit number.

00:01:30.444 --> 00:01:32.625
There are many different hashing functions,

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:38.709
but Bitcoin uses SHA256 to create a unique hash value for each block on the blockchain.

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:40.669
The reason for this is to create

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.185
a unique identifier for every block that exists on the chain.

00:01:44.185 --> 00:01:46.219
This allows us to do some cool things,

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:48.590
like references are blocked by its hash value.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.040
It even creates the foundation from which we can join blocks together into a chain.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.120
To understand how this builds the chain,

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.295
we'll need to understand blocks and blockchains a little better.

00:01:58.295 --> 00:02:00.805
We'll learn more about these topics next.

00:02:00.805 --> 00:02:05.640
But first, we'll walk through a demonstration showing SHA256 in action.
