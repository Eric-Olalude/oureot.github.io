00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.945
When talking about the blockchain,

00:00:01.945 --> 00:00:04.150
you'll often hear the network come up.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.290
The blockchain is supported by a network more specifically

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.585
known as a distributed peer-to-peer network.

00:00:10.585 --> 00:00:12.420
In this video, we'll cover what

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:16.844
a distributed peer-to-peer network is and compare it to some other types of networks.

00:00:16.844 --> 00:00:19.229
Now a peer-to-peer network is a network of

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.875
computers that allows information to be shared across users.

00:00:22.875 --> 00:00:27.329
It allows users known as nodes to send information directly

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:31.784
between one another without the need for a central authority to hold that information.

00:00:31.785 --> 00:00:34.869
So it's a way to connect users to be able to share information.

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:38.929
As an example, think of any chat service like Skype,

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:40.804
WeChat or Google Hangouts.

00:00:40.804 --> 00:00:45.615
These are all peer-to-peer networks that allow you to talk with your friends and family.

00:00:45.615 --> 00:00:47.370
If you're unfamiliar with these apps,

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:49.619
you can also think of phones as an example.

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:52.744
Phones give peer-to-peer access to anyone else with a phone,

00:00:52.744 --> 00:00:56.054
and the blockchain is also a peer-to-peer network.

00:00:56.054 --> 00:01:00.530
This allows us to interact directly with other peers on the blockchain.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.710
But the blockchain isn't only peer-to-peer, it's also distributed.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:08.750
A distributed network is similar to the idea of a peer-to-peer network.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.620
It's a network that allows information to be spread across many users.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.439
So while being peer-to-peer allows open communication across users,

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.299
being distributed allows that information itself to be owned by those users.

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.769
To understand a distributed network,

00:01:23.769 --> 00:01:27.104
it helps to see how it compares with other types of networks.

00:01:27.105 --> 00:01:29.390
Here, we'll compare centralized,

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.424
decentralized and distributed networks.

00:01:32.424 --> 00:01:34.234
As we talk through these examples,

00:01:34.234 --> 00:01:38.859
keep in mind that each type of network has its own strengths and use cases.

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:43.010
The blockchain is in distributed because that's simply the best type of network.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.000
It's distributed specifically because it's trying to avoid being centralized.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.040
It's chosen to avoid the problems it sees with centralizing

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.395
information in favor of the benefits it sees in a distributed system.

00:01:54.394 --> 00:01:55.994
In a centralised system,

00:01:55.995 --> 00:01:58.740
everything connects to a central network owner.

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:00.684
This owner can be a person,

00:02:00.685 --> 00:02:02.500
a company or a database.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.439
If there's only a single source that holds all the information for the system,

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.034
it's a centralised system.

00:02:08.034 --> 00:02:09.449
To help picture this,

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:12.464
imagine a library that contains all the books in the world.

00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:14.430
Anytime you want information,

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.230
you'd have to go to this library to get it.

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:19.543
The information in this case is completely centralized.

00:02:19.544 --> 00:02:24.540
So this can be very effective and is extremely common way to share information.

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:27.234
But what if our library were destroyed?

00:02:27.235 --> 00:02:29.555
Well in this case, we would lose everything.

00:02:29.555 --> 00:02:31.719
In a completely centralized system,

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:34.569
we wouldn't have any way to recover this information.

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.084
Another possible issue could be speed.

00:02:37.085 --> 00:02:39.909
To get a book, you'll need to go all the way to

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:42.615
the library no matter how far away you might live.

00:02:42.615 --> 00:02:44.495
To help address some of these concerns,

00:02:44.495 --> 00:02:46.564
other types of networks have been created.

00:02:46.564 --> 00:02:49.764
One of these is called a decentralized network.

00:02:49.764 --> 00:02:51.414
In a decentralized network,

00:02:51.414 --> 00:02:55.144
there's no longer a single point where all this information exists.

00:02:55.145 --> 00:02:59.139
Instead, this information is spread across multiple locations.

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:02.115
So instead of holding all our books in a single library,

00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:04.625
we have many libraries spread throughout the city.

00:03:04.625 --> 00:03:07.719
Duplicates of each book could exist in each library.

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:09.609
Now if our library were destroyed,

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.070
we'll lose some of these resources and that's definitely

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.894
really sad but we don't lose all the information.

00:03:14.895 --> 00:03:17.825
We still have backups of these books in other locations.

00:03:17.824 --> 00:03:21.864
Here, we could also have libraries spread out and easier to access.

00:03:21.865 --> 00:03:25.620
Instead of having to go all the way to a center of a large city,

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.080
you have a library down the street or in your local town.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.335
A distributed system is a decentralized system pushed to its furthest limits.

00:03:34.335 --> 00:03:36.025
In a distributed system,

00:03:36.025 --> 00:03:40.935
everyone gets a copy of the information with the same access and control as anyone else.

00:03:40.935 --> 00:03:44.275
There's no centralization of the information at all.

00:03:44.275 --> 00:03:48.724
This gives everyone equal access to whatever information that they need.

00:03:48.724 --> 00:03:52.139
If we extend our library example just a little bit further,

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:55.174
we can use it to describe a distributed system.

00:03:55.175 --> 00:03:59.030
To help imagine it, pretend our library holds 50 books.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.250
This is small enough that you could fit them all in your personal bookshelf.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.800
So let's say a whole group of people each get

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.530
their own 50 books to put onto the personal bookshelves.

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.990
This will create a network where everyone has

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.525
quick and easy access to all the information that already exists.

00:04:13.525 --> 00:04:16.350
This is the idea behind a distributed network.

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.535
Since we now each have information,

00:04:18.535 --> 00:04:20.835
we wouldn't really have much use for the library.

00:04:20.834 --> 00:04:23.639
But whether it's library books, data,

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:25.694
ledgers or anything else,

00:04:25.694 --> 00:04:29.564
these core concepts about the way we share information still applies.

00:04:29.564 --> 00:04:31.829
So that's the idea behind centralized,

00:04:31.829 --> 00:04:34.274
decentralized and distributed networks.

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:36.384
Now, let's go back to the blockchain.

00:04:36.384 --> 00:04:38.149
Why was all this important?

00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:41.639
It's important because the blockchain is a distributed network.

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:45.365
If a distributed network gives everyone ownership of the information,

00:04:45.365 --> 00:04:47.275
how do we do this with a blockchain?

00:04:47.274 --> 00:04:51.414
Here, everyone downloads a copy of the blockchain to their local computer.

00:04:51.415 --> 00:04:53.830
They interact with this copy of the blockchain and

00:04:53.829 --> 00:04:56.495
have full access to all the information it contains.

00:04:56.495 --> 00:04:58.735
This is similar to the library example with

00:04:58.735 --> 00:05:01.435
everyone having access and control over their books.

00:05:01.435 --> 00:05:03.829
So we don't need to go to the library to find them.

00:05:03.829 --> 00:05:07.060
With everyone having access to the transaction information,

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.420
we don't need anyone else like a bank to track that information for us.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.050
This distributed system is one way the blockchain is

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.750
attempting to bypass the need for external third parties.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.334
So, that's how the blockchain operates as a distributed peer-to-peer network.

00:05:21.334 --> 00:05:25.139
It allows everyone to interact freely with one another on the network,

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:30.439
and it gives everyone full access to the transaction histories held on the blockchain.
