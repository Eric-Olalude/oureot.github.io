00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.654
Congratulations on getting through this lesson

00:00:02.654 --> 00:00:05.339
on smart contracts for supply chain management.

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.789
In this lesson, we went over how smart contracts can work as

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:12.329
an extremely valuable tool for the management of supply chains.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.265
After learning some of the basics,

00:00:14.265 --> 00:00:16.365
you got hands-on and started outlining,

00:00:16.364 --> 00:00:19.529
diagramming, and coding a supply chain for yourself.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.740
Along the way, we focus on the thought process behind

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:25.619
developing an application that solves a real-world need,

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.205
and discussed all the code we wrote together in a lot of detail.

00:00:29.204 --> 00:00:32.750
The goal was for you to feel comfortable extending this contract,

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.390
adding new functionality, and to be able to create

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.064
smart contracts for entirely new supply chains for yourself.

00:00:39.064 --> 00:00:40.908
In the last few concepts,

00:00:40.908 --> 00:00:43.460
you went through a series of challenges meant to help you think

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.954
through how to provide that new functionality to your users.

00:00:46.954 --> 00:00:52.219
This was a huge step towards making effective applications to solve real-world problems.

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:54.740
If you'd like, take some time to experiment

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.829
even further to add as much functionality as you'd like.

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:59.689
That wraps up this lesson.

00:00:59.689 --> 00:01:03.019
I hope you enjoyed working with the concepts and are able to confidently

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.579
tackle even larger supply chain problems using solidity in the future.
