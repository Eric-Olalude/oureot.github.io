00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
The next topic is cost.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.429
We all know that when you submit a transaction to

00:00:05.429 --> 00:00:09.629
the blockchain for Ethereum in particular and some other blockchains as well,

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.050
there is a transaction cost in the form of gas.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.810
Many users are not used to this paradigm,

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.695
especially users who are entering the new world of cryptocurrency.

00:00:19.695 --> 00:00:22.289
They are used to credit cards et cetera,

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.614
where the actual transaction cost is hidden and paid by the vendor.

00:00:27.614 --> 00:00:31.144
They're also not used to this experience

00:00:31.144 --> 00:00:35.390
where they might undertake a transaction it might fail, however,

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.869
they are still charged for that and they will put

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:43.519
the blame on the creator of the DAP or whatever service that is being used.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.440
So it's important for you to communicate through the DAP about

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:53.570
what exactly a transaction cost is going to be and also

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.590
inform the user that this is a blockchain cost and

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.210
that it is not being charged by the service and also inform them that

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.439
there's a possibility that if the transaction does not fully complete

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:11.209
a portion of the cost of the transaction will still be levied.

00:01:11.209 --> 00:01:15.694
This is super important when building user confidence in your application

00:01:15.694 --> 00:01:20.319
early on because if you don't do this, ultimately,

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:25.234
if there are failing transactions because of blockchain speed et cetera,

00:01:25.234 --> 00:01:29.780
it's your DAP and by association you or

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.489
your organization that is looked on unfavorably by the user.

00:01:34.489 --> 00:01:37.819
So it's very easy to mitigate and be very clear about

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:41.674
the transaction costs and make sure that the user knows that they might

00:01:41.674 --> 00:01:45.539
not get their full transaction back if

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:52.010
the process is interrupted or fails due to a requirement.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.130
So those were the first three user experience topics.

00:01:56.129 --> 00:02:00.030
Let's pause here and take a quick quiz.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.200
So the question is,

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.924
blockchain transactions can take an indeterminate amount of time to process.

00:02:07.924 --> 00:02:14.099
What technique can you use to help the user understand this concept?
