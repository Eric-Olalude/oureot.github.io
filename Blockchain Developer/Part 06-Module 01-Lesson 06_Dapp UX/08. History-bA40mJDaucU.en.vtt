00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.984
Our next topic is History.

00:00:02.984 --> 00:00:08.025
Now when many of us use bank applications,

00:00:08.025 --> 00:00:12.435
we almost always expect to see a history of our transactions.

00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:14.310
When we use our web browser,

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.855
we also expect to be able to go back and see the history of our transactions.

00:00:18.855 --> 00:00:22.740
When we use certain social media apps like maybe Twitter etc.,

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:25.619
the history is implicit.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.679
When we use games and such,

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:31.199
there is no concept of a history.

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.744
In the context of a blockchain-based DAP,

00:00:35.744 --> 00:00:38.079
history is very important,

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.905
mainly because the amount of time that may elapse

00:00:42.905 --> 00:00:49.160
between when a user initiates an action and when the result of that action is available,

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:50.419
could be substantially long,

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.844
it could be five minutes,

00:00:51.844 --> 00:00:53.960
it could be five hours.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.259
It's important for us to be able to put the user back in the frame of mind,

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:03.754
back in the context where they were when they initiate a transaction,

00:01:03.755 --> 00:01:08.704
so they can go back and see what happened at the time of a notification comes in.

00:01:08.704 --> 00:01:11.120
So earlier, we talked about event notifications.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.250
So imagine some time has elapsed and there's now

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.010
a notification about a previous transaction.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.505
What does the user do with that notification other than look at it?

00:01:19.504 --> 00:01:22.069
Well, they should be able to interact with it,

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:25.279
they should be able to go and navigate to a history where they

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.685
can see what exactly they did and when.

00:01:28.685 --> 00:01:32.525
This is important because we can't expect users

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:37.250
to have that cognitive load of always remembering what they did,

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.439
when they did, and why they did it, etc.

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.054
It's our job in the user interface to give them

00:01:43.055 --> 00:01:47.450
that history so that when the notification arrives, they can see that.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.730
Now we don't think of DAPs necessarily as bank applications,

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.710
but when they do in bulk cryptocurrency,

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:55.829
it's the users money,

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.310
they want to be able to go and account for that kind of stuff.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.234
So another dual purpose your history can do,

00:02:01.234 --> 00:02:06.575
is serve to act as the user's personal ledger of what they did,

00:02:06.575 --> 00:02:09.050
including financial transactions, etc.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.305
So it's a good way to give the user back

00:02:12.305 --> 00:02:15.830
some of the control they lose when they start using a DAP,

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.710
is by having a history and give them back that time,

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.530
put them there, so they can remember what happened.
