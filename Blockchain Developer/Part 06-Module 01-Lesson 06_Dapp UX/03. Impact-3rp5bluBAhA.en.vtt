00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.915
The next topic is impact.

00:00:03.915 --> 00:00:06.900
Frequently, when you have adapt,

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:15.030
a user will be presented with an option to perhaps send money or to submit a transaction.

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:19.219
What isn't clear to them given that there are so many options on

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:23.750
the dialogues and so many complex terms that they're not familiar with,

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.550
they usually don't know what's going to happen when I do this.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.265
Will I lose my money?

00:00:29.265 --> 00:00:32.990
Will I be sharing my private details with someone?

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.030
Will this work?

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.329
Do I have to do anything else to make it work successfully?

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.679
So these are the topics that you want to address upfront.

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:47.840
So whenever you have a transaction that is going to change state,

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.660
it's very important that you clearly present to

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:53.719
the user what exactly will happen when they take

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.524
the action both in terms of

00:00:56.524 --> 00:01:01.229
data and also especially if there's any financial transaction involved,

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:04.519
what's going to happen to their money whether it's cryptocurrency,

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.414
or tokens, or any such thing.

00:01:07.415 --> 00:01:11.359
So being very clear upfront with the user,

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:15.590
what is going to happen when they take the specific action is a great way to

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.969
ensure that users are not fearful of using your app,

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:24.094
and can comfortably go through and confidently go through knowing that

00:01:24.094 --> 00:01:29.730
when they take a particular action it's going to do something that they are aware off.
