00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.004
Our next big challenge is the concept of addresses.

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:10.649
So initially when you start using cryptocurrency and working with blockchain etc,

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.414
you just are amazed by how long some of these addresses are etc.

00:00:17.414 --> 00:00:21.929
Over time as you get into it you get really desensitized to it.

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:25.559
What you lose sight of is the fact that

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:29.669
the things that we take for granted that are pretty straightforward zero,

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.535
X and a whole bunch of hex characters etc,

00:00:32.534 --> 00:00:35.774
are pretty alien to normal users.

00:00:35.774 --> 00:00:41.789
But in most wallets and DAP browsers etc,

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:46.414
users are continually faced with using these addresses.

00:00:46.414 --> 00:00:48.229
This is an alien concept to them.

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:49.654
They are not used to it at all.

00:00:49.655 --> 00:00:52.145
So it's up to us as

00:00:52.145 --> 00:00:57.725
DAP developers setting sort of the standard here is to really make it easy.

00:00:57.725 --> 00:01:02.780
So a few things you can do is don't show the entire address in the UI.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.640
It's usually not necessary.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.275
Instead, what you should do is generally start off the,

00:01:09.275 --> 00:01:10.580
if it's an Ethereum address,

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:13.640
start off with a zero X, show an ellipses,

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.450
and perhaps show the last four to five digits of the address but make

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.310
it so that when the user hovers or touches depending on the context,

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.909
whether it's mobile or desktop,

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.265
that the whole address is then visible.

00:01:25.265 --> 00:01:27.094
So don't make it opaque.

00:01:27.094 --> 00:01:33.319
But don't have your UI polluted with addresses all over the place,

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:34.789
because it can make for

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.805
a very unsightly user experience and also a very unsightly visual experience.

00:01:40.805 --> 00:01:45.110
Now there are many situations where a user has to copy

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:49.370
that address and paste it into their wallet or something like that.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.280
So what you need to do is as you're building

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.855
your app look for those opportunities and try and make them smart.

00:01:55.855 --> 00:02:00.665
Anticipate what's going to happen and show a Copy icon or

00:02:00.665 --> 00:02:05.810
even proactively if you can do it without messing with the users clipboard,

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.425
get that into their clipboard.

00:02:09.425 --> 00:02:11.120
Assuming that you know

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.224
that they don't have something else important that's already there.

00:02:14.224 --> 00:02:21.364
But last but not least at least make sure that the address is selectable.

00:02:21.365 --> 00:02:24.020
You'll see many applications where you try and drag

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.439
across but they've used some JavaScript to disable that

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:29.599
and so it becomes almost impossible and you have to

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.969
resort to all kinds of tricks to try and

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:36.680
copy an address that's super frustrating for users and you want to avoid that.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.990
So while this seems like a very trivial thing

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.395
addresses you see them all over the place in the user interface,

00:02:42.395 --> 00:02:46.820
it is absolutely a point of frustration for users and you

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.745
want to take care to make sure that you don't frustrate users.

00:02:51.745 --> 00:02:56.140
All right. Let's take another quiz.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.530
How can you increase user trust in your DAP?
