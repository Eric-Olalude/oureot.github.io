00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.149
Now, we are onto the last topic in our user experience for Web3,

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:10.934
and I think this is the most important topic.

00:00:10.935 --> 00:00:18.899
Affordance, this might be an unfamiliar term if you haven't been a designer,

00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:20.445
a front end designer.

00:00:20.445 --> 00:00:25.019
Essentially, it is the ability to create things that are

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.939
so intuitive that it does not require the user to think.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.905
The example up on the screen here is of a mug.

00:00:34.905 --> 00:00:39.980
It doesn't take much for people to figure out how to use a mug,

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:41.719
you just pick it up, and you go;

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:43.384
the handle is very intuitive.

00:00:43.384 --> 00:00:44.989
So that's an affordance.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.429
So what you have to think about as you're designing your Dapp,

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:52.789
and you think about all the other nine things we've talked about.

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:58.504
But overall, you put them all together and think about the affordance of your app.

00:00:58.505 --> 00:01:04.519
The key takeaway is four words: don't make me think.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.819
If you can build a Dapp in such a way that the user does not have to think,

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:13.909
it's very clear to them what's going to happen next,

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:15.274
what they just did,

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:19.490
and what their actions are going to create.

00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:22.969
It really creates a kind of joy and

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:27.829
a user experience that people will like using your Dapp for.

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:30.034
So as you're building your Dapp,

00:01:30.034 --> 00:01:34.774
whether it's the smart contract or the front end or the APIs, etc.,

00:01:34.775 --> 00:01:39.180
remember that affordance is the key goal you want to achieve,

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.350
and it is not going to happen if you just

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:46.534
delegate that to the front end designer because ultimately,

00:01:46.534 --> 00:01:49.084
especially in blockchain apps,

00:01:49.084 --> 00:01:55.594
you have to design in that both at the smart contract level and at the API level.

00:01:55.594 --> 00:02:01.204
As an example, consider how would the affordance related to communicating

00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:07.504
event information work if the smart contract does not have the events being emitted?

00:02:07.504 --> 00:02:10.984
So that's a very simple way to think about it.

00:02:10.985 --> 00:02:15.815
So it requires all the parties involved that all the layers of the app

00:02:15.814 --> 00:02:18.229
to work together to really think

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:21.099
about what is the affordance we're building into this for the user.

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.829
At what point are we subjecting the user to

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.895
a cognitive load that makes the Dapp not friendly,

00:02:28.895 --> 00:02:32.600
not interesting, not something they want to keep using.

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.439
So you want to go through those views.

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:43.710
You want to go through those tasks and make sure that your app has a stellar affordance.

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:48.629
All right. Let's take another quiz.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.534
What single technique can greatly increase the user experience of your Dapp?

00:02:55.534 --> 00:03:00.259
A, provide help text or icons as much as possible; B,

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:04.884
Have how-to videos in the UI for important tasks; C,

00:03:04.884 --> 00:03:08.794
use a third party UI framework that has been optimized for usability;

00:03:08.794 --> 00:03:13.229
or D, don't make the user think.

00:03:57.289 --> 00:04:02.909
Yes, the answer is don't make the user think.
