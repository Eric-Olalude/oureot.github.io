00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
Welcome back. Hopefully, you had some time to read through that blog post,

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.380
to learn about a few of the frameworks available in Node.js.

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.810
There's a lot of options, but in this lesson,

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.405
we'll focus specifically on three of them: Express, Sails, and Hapi.

00:00:14.404 --> 00:00:16.739
Each of these are powerful frameworks with

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:19.564
great documentation that are easily to get set up with.

00:00:19.565 --> 00:00:21.390
Before jumping into the code,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.524
let's take a quick look at why they were built,

00:00:23.524 --> 00:00:26.109
and what problems they're meant to help solve.

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:30.149
First, let's go over to expressjs.com.

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:32.129
Here's the homepage for this framework,

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.885
that you can look to for everything from getting started to developer documentation.

00:00:36.884 --> 00:00:39.015
They pitched themselves as a fast,

00:00:39.015 --> 00:00:42.755
unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.

00:00:42.755 --> 00:00:46.780
Express was an early framework that helped lead to many other solutions.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.439
It was designed primarily as a middleware and routing framework.

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:52.879
It's common in Fullstack applications,

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.255
two of which are the MEAN,

00:00:54.255 --> 00:00:57.445
and MERN stacks, where the E stands for Express.

00:00:57.445 --> 00:01:00.109
Learning Express is extremely valuable,

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:02.929
and will both help you develop applications as well as

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:07.114
understand many of the concepts related to other Node.js frameworks.

00:01:07.114 --> 00:01:10.884
One of these frameworks that stem from Express is Sails.

00:01:10.885 --> 00:01:15.015
Sails is a real-time MVC framework for Node.js.

00:01:15.015 --> 00:01:18.695
You can get to their website by going to sailsjs.com.

00:01:18.694 --> 00:01:20.739
Here, you'll see they're Get Started section,

00:01:20.739 --> 00:01:24.214
and can scroll down a little to see more about what they're hoping to solve.

00:01:24.215 --> 00:01:28.505
They make it easy to build custom enterprise-ready Node.js apps.

00:01:28.504 --> 00:01:30.739
It was built to help teams build scalable

00:01:30.739 --> 00:01:34.214
Node.js projects for startup and enterprise customers.

00:01:34.215 --> 00:01:36.310
We'll be coming back to this site soon,,

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.870
but first I wanted to go over and give you a quick intro to the Hapi framework as well.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.605
We can go to their website at Hapijs.com.

00:01:44.605 --> 00:01:49.704
Their pitch is that Hapi is a rich framework for building applications and services.

00:01:49.704 --> 00:01:52.670
Hapi was built by Walmart to solve problems they were

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.015
having trying to manage their applications using Express.

00:01:56.015 --> 00:01:58.750
Trying to manage the codebase wasn't scaling well,

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.064
and Hapi has tried to design a more scalable solution.

00:02:02.064 --> 00:02:05.715
So, that wraps up a very quick intro to these three frameworks.

00:02:05.715 --> 00:02:08.580
Before moving on, feel free to look around through these sites,

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.800
and try installing them, or getting started.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.400
This installation and getting started is also

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.765
what we're going to be going over in the next few sections.

00:02:15.764 --> 00:02:17.924
So, if you want to try it on your own, that's great.

00:02:17.925 --> 00:02:21.170
But if not, then you can follow along throughout the rest of the lesson.

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:23.419
When you're ready, I'll see you in the next section where

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:26.459
we'll start working more closely with Express.
