00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.555
Hi. I'm here today with Jarrod Dicker from Po.et.

00:00:03.555 --> 00:00:05.910
Share with us a little bit about your role at Po.et.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.220
Sure. I'm the CEO at Po.et.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.060
I joined in the end of February,

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.320
early March this year.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.330
It feels like I've been here for years,

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.850
but it's actually only been about seven months.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.780
Prior, I ran innovation at the Washington Post.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.150
My background's in media, Washington Post,

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.190
I was at the Huffington Post, I was at Time Inc.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.020
So I always held roles where there was

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.250
a ton of focus and energy towards how we build a better model as it pertains to media,

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.520
how we could create the road that we want to drive on that's relevant to our business.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.190
I don't know how many people who watch this understand the media business,

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.390
but it's constantly driving uphill when it comes to advertising dollars,

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.550
subscription dollars, getting user attention,

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:53.990
the relationship with the platform.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.380
So there's a huge opportunity when it comes to

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.680
investment in innovating and thinking differently about those models.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.590
So that clearly drew me to Po.et,

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.920
which was this idea of what if these things become decentralized.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.410
What if we really start to open up the definitions of what it means to be a creator,

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.120
and what it means to be distributed on platforms,

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.440
and how people get paid,

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.445
and how reputation gets built.

00:01:20.445 --> 00:01:22.400
That is something that when you boil it down,

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.250
it really needs something that is decentralized.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.510
That's not necessarily being managed or walled garden within a certain platform,

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.370
but really allows people to be interoperable.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.080
So I'm now here,

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.450
I'm the CEO of this company.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.340
What we're really looking to build is what

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.345
the future media economy looks like for everyone.

00:01:40.345 --> 00:01:43.850
Share with us a value proposition of Po.et's services

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.015
like what's it doing on the decentralized world,

00:01:47.015 --> 00:01:49.850
what's it doing now that's valuable to folks.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.290
Po.et is extremely focused on what its reputation look like on the web,

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.410
which frankly, I don't believe exists at this point.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.039
There are ways to discover information,

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:04.280
and that's broken down on social platforms,

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.320
and through certain search engines like Google,

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.030
where you could search for information based on

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.040
relevance or based on the time it was created.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.445
But you don't necessarily know that the information that you're getting is

00:02:13.445 --> 00:02:17.135
authored by the person you think it is or has this information been fact-checked,

00:02:17.135 --> 00:02:18.530
who's paying for this information,

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.850
and there's just a list beyond list of opportunities to be able to

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.355
gain more information or so the ingredients behind which you are about to consume.

00:02:27.355 --> 00:02:30.560
Po.et is looking to play that role at a protocol level.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.800
What are the tools that we could build that enable anyone

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.070
to be able to own their IP, have their information,

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.110
whether that's art or music,

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.470
or journalism or photography to be able to have that

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.205
immutable and own the ledger via Po.et.

00:02:46.205 --> 00:02:50.120
Then paired with that by being able to leverage token economics.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.505
Po.et in itself has a token, POE,

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:55.880
how could we then incentivize people to build reputation on top of that.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.280
What are the incentive models,

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.200
both intrinsic and extrinsic,

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.680
that can be done to find out who is the author of something.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.090
When was something created?

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.465
Do people have the rights to be able to license this information?

00:03:08.465 --> 00:03:12.035
Is it fair to say that it's content notarized?

00:03:12.035 --> 00:03:15.135
Yeah. There's a few angles for it.

00:03:15.135 --> 00:03:18.345
Copyright and notary is definitely one.

00:03:18.345 --> 00:03:22.010
I think provenance and being able to see

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.890
the source of information and how it traveled to where it is currently being consumed.

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.760
So that could be on a contractual level,

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.370
like was this thing signed by this person,

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.360
and how do we have proof of that existence?

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.140
That could be, I'm watching a video and how do I

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.870
know that this video of Donald Trump speaking is

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.570
actually Donald Trump speaking and not a deep fake that is

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.585
created from another country rather via propaganda?

00:03:44.585 --> 00:03:47.210
These are more and more issues that are coming up.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.940
I think that your assumption of it being

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.075
tied to notary or people say it tied to attribution

00:03:53.075 --> 00:03:59.540
is very real and a serious case of how Po.et is being used and distributed.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.830
But I think it also opens up an entirely new slew of things that it could be

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.555
used if it is important to find ownership, attribution, and discovery.

00:04:08.555 --> 00:04:11.045
What does that mean for the modern web era?

00:04:11.045 --> 00:04:13.820
I think it's a value proposition that's important

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.555
because more and more assets are getting into the digital ledger,

00:04:17.555 --> 00:04:22.020
and they're containing a storage of value in one way or another.

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.195
Content is also another way to look at value.

00:04:25.195 --> 00:04:26.395
Content is valuable.

00:04:26.395 --> 00:04:27.955
You mentioned ranking.

00:04:27.955 --> 00:04:32.255
Share with us a little bit more about what you're doing for ranking.

00:04:32.255 --> 00:04:35.130
We're looking to expose this information.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.800
I think when you look at curation in the modern day sense,

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.325
like the role of an algorithm like Facebook or Google,

00:04:43.325 --> 00:04:46.005
or a media company like The Washington Post or BuzzFeed,

00:04:46.005 --> 00:04:48.170
you rely on them for curation.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:49.944
Whether that is manual curation,

00:04:49.944 --> 00:04:54.070
like an editor has done for the past 100 years in a newspaper or

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.810
that's curation based on certain information like personalized curation,

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.060
what your news feed delivers you and what Google delivers to you.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.100
What I think we're looking to do is the next level of this,

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.945
which is what do rankings and curation look like when it's on a more personal level?

00:05:10.945 --> 00:05:15.340
We don't necessarily want to say this is right and this is wrong,

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.110
or these are the best, or this is the worst,

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.350
or this is black and this white,

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:23.335
because I think that's why we're constantly continuing to go in separate directions.

00:05:23.335 --> 00:05:25.525
Again, not to get political, but as a country we are.

00:05:25.525 --> 00:05:27.520
But also in terms of the information you trust,

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.805
and what you read, and who you listen to.

00:05:30.805 --> 00:05:35.720
Our ways of combating that is curating even further so that people that didn't

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.550
trust this in the first place aren't now going to

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.755
trust it because you say it's the best or you say,

00:05:39.755 --> 00:05:41.585
"Oh no, but we are doing this properly."

00:05:41.585 --> 00:05:44.870
There needs to be some outside or third-party verifier

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.230
that is able to give that information.

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:51.080
That changes the way that my view of the world is to

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.950
your view of the world and the information that we choose to consume is consumable.

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.610
I think that we change the world for the better,

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.100
and rankings and information for the better by

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.385
addressing the gray area at large and not saying,

00:06:04.385 --> 00:06:06.440
this doesn't fit but this does fit.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.135
But here's all of the world's information,

00:06:09.135 --> 00:06:13.450
and here are the exposure or signals of that information,

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.220
and then you can so choose like you would smoking cigarettes,

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.125
or drinking alcohol, or eating fast food.

00:06:18.125 --> 00:06:20.745
If you still want to go for it, go for it.

00:06:20.745 --> 00:06:22.920
We're not here to tell you not to, but hopefully,

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.160
we can help inform people that are looking

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.560
for something deeper or want to better understand

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:33.125
what information they are about to bring in and retain in order to do so.

00:06:33.125 --> 00:06:37.700
What we start to do with this breakdown of the middle is basically saying,

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.675
here is all of this information for you to make the decisions on your own,

00:06:41.675 --> 00:06:44.705
knowing that you will want to consume what you consume,

00:06:44.705 --> 00:06:47.959
how do you take that outside of these platforms?

00:06:47.959 --> 00:06:52.640
That's a huge theme that I've been obsessing over lately, which is interoperability.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.700
We're so locked in to centralized platforms.

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.820
Like everything I do on Facebook is limited to Facebook,

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.910
granted some bleeds over to Instagram because they're owned by the same company.

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:05.855
But then I go to Google and I have to do everything over.

00:07:05.855 --> 00:07:08.060
If I have my own blog, I have to do everything over.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.520
All of these different platforms, they're not interoperable.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.500
So me as a creator, writer,

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.465
or any IP that I'm doing,

00:07:14.465 --> 00:07:17.000
I basically need to replicate across all these platforms.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.330
Well, with these new systems that are non reliant on some central authority,

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.410
can I just had this more interoperability approach where I could choose to use Instagram,

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:28.550
I could choose to use Facebook,

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:34.650
I could choose to use any video player I want or any image gallery I want.

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:37.520
But basically, my reputation is what carries everywhere and it's

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.440
not necessarily reliant on the platform itself.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.320
The people that I've been talking to had been

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.155
grasping it more and more and seeing it more and more as,

00:07:45.155 --> 00:07:47.990
wow, we as individuals are bringing value,

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:50.720
yet that value is non-transferable,

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.010
but I myself am the one that's bringing value to these platforms,

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:57.920
so how come I'm not reaping the rewards of bringing value to these platforms?

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.260
I think that that has everything to do with the fact that

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.930
there's incentives of centralized systems to keep

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:05.240
those systems intact and not

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.570
necessarily give too much away or bleed over into competing systems.

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:12.520
A lot of people challenge what I talk about when it comes to,

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:18.050
because when I talk about with building reputation and building information on the web,

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:22.400
you can look back at what SEO did for links and what social did

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:27.725
for creators in the first level and now what these centralization is doing here.

00:08:27.725 --> 00:08:29.015
People often say, well,

00:08:29.015 --> 00:08:31.310
it sounds like you're blowing everything up,

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:35.430
but then you're going to come back to this point that we've been at before.

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:37.980
I think that's a real concern.

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:40.250
I don't necessarily know if the word is concerned,

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:43.490
but I think even when you look at Bitcoin and blockchain

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:47.030
and how the currency and financial elements are coming about,

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:50.975
we may end up in something similar but a little better.

00:08:50.975 --> 00:08:52.885
I think that makes all the efforts worth it.

00:08:52.885 --> 00:08:56.790
We've learned and know full well now that we

00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:00.670
can't just rebuild within the structures that currently exists.

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:04.405
Because we keep trying to do that and it works,

00:09:04.405 --> 00:09:06.190
and it looks pretty for a few years,

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:11.525
and then the paint peels and you still see the broken foundations that it was built on.

00:09:11.525 --> 00:09:13.250
What this movement has really

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:17.150
allowed is people like me and others to really go out there and say,

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:19.590
we have to tear it all down and we have to rebuild it.

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:22.880
Even if some components of the house are similar,

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.700
we're going to learn from our past of how

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:28.595
things were built and try to build it in a more feasible open way.

00:09:28.595 --> 00:09:32.360
There's a very realistic scenario where that happens again,

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.750
where we're talking about decentralized computing and decentralized applications,

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:37.910
and then we'd find that even though things are somewhat better,

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:40.120
we're going back to centralized approach.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:45.930
We at Po.et are working really hard enough to do that, and it's tough.

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:50.390
It's tough because there are companies out there like media companies,

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:54.935
or technology companies, or brands that are willing to work with us directly today.

00:09:54.935 --> 00:10:00.590
They don't necessarily want us to shed our morals or our notion of decentralization,

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:02.450
but there are certain things that they needed.

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:07.070
These can be things like private storage that they need done in

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:08.975
order to be working together that are

00:10:08.975 --> 00:10:11.450
counter intuitive to why we're doing this in the first place.

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:14.720
But I think that it's important and you raised a good point

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:18.245
where we should be extremely honest with where we are,

00:10:18.245 --> 00:10:20.810
and we should really identify the value points

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:23.535
of what blockchain could be and how we get there.

00:10:23.535 --> 00:10:29.285
I think what attracts me to blockchain is that it's a very human dependent technology,

00:10:29.285 --> 00:10:33.230
that it really requires the contributions of many and

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:34.700
a lot of different thinkers and

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.325
different way of doing things in order for it to be successful.

00:10:37.325 --> 00:10:40.535
So it can't just necessarily sit dormant.

00:10:40.535 --> 00:10:42.500
It can't be centralized.

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.240
It needs to be influenced by a lot of

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.790
outside components in order for it

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:49.660
to go to where it needs to be and be as successful as it can.

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:52.280
Excellent. Thank you so much for spending time with us today.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:52.415
Thank you.

00:10:52.415 --> 00:10:53.600
It was enjoyable.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.530
I really appreciate it.

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:56.975
Very brilliant. I love the vision of Po.et.

00:10:56.975 --> 00:10:57.605
Fantastic.

00:10:57.605 --> 00:10:58.070
Thank you.

00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:59.700
Thank you.
