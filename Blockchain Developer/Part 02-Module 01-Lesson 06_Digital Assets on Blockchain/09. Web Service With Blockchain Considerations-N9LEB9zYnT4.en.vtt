00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
A blockchain can be thought of as a type of database,

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.574
which means that we can plug it in as a server or the backend part of a Web service.

00:00:08.574 --> 00:00:13.515
Doing so allows the information to be consumable by a client application.

00:00:13.515 --> 00:00:18.344
Now, you might be wondering, does every blockchain need to interact with Web service?

00:00:18.344 --> 00:00:21.015
That's what we'll be discussing in this section.

00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:23.149
What to consider when deciding if

00:00:23.149 --> 00:00:26.584
your blockchain use case requires integrating with the Web service.

00:00:26.585 --> 00:00:28.839
So here are some considerations when deciding if

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:31.925
your blockchain should or should not integrate with the Web service.

00:00:31.925 --> 00:00:34.280
First, if your'e in your use case,

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.814
consumers require a user interface in order to interact with the application,

00:00:38.814 --> 00:00:40.990
then a Web service is needed.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.255
With a Web service, you can configure the application

00:00:44.255 --> 00:00:48.005
with the blockchain service to be consumable over the Internet.

00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:50.100
Let's see an example of this.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.670
Say we have a blockchain that contains medical health records.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.295
This blockchain contains private patient data such as the patient's name,

00:00:58.295 --> 00:01:00.635
their diagnosis, and their vitals.

00:01:00.634 --> 00:01:03.320
Saving data on the blockchain allows it to be

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.239
securely encrypted and decrypted into a digest,

00:01:06.239 --> 00:01:08.509
so that only those with proper access such as

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.195
health care providers can rightfully access it.

00:01:11.194 --> 00:01:13.834
Integrating the blockchain with a Web service

00:01:13.834 --> 00:01:16.759
allows our healthcare providers to securely retrieve,

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.960
view, and edit this data.

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:23.089
Some more things to consider if you have a Web service integrated with the blockchain,

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.685
are whether or not every client needs to communicate with its own app instance.

00:01:27.685 --> 00:01:31.210
Also, is there a desire for no central server?

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:34.599
This can be a safeguard if something were to happen to that central server.

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:37.009
Well, in this case, using a web service

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.965
integrated with a blockchain is likely to be a good choice.

00:01:39.965 --> 00:01:42.965
Alternatively, it's important to remember that

00:01:42.965 --> 00:01:46.630
not every blockchain situation requires integrating with the Web service.

00:01:46.629 --> 00:01:51.129
Remember, certain tasks can be handled without using a Web service.

00:01:51.129 --> 00:01:54.739
For example, executing a contract can be done without using

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:56.449
a Web service by just using

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.049
a dedicated wallet or directly from the command line terminal.

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:01.640
Also, if you're building

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.155
a mobile application that communicates with the blockchain platform directly,

00:02:05.155 --> 00:02:07.719
then there's no need for a Web service.

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:11.599
To recap, we discussed the considerations to think about when

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.724
determining if a blockchain should or should not integrate with the web service.

00:02:15.724 --> 00:02:18.939
Remember that there are pros and cons to each decision.

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:21.500
So, take the due diligence to research

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.405
the implications doing so will have on your project when faced with this question.

00:02:25.405 --> 00:02:27.784
Now, can you think of at least one more reason

00:02:27.784 --> 00:02:31.335
a blockchain should and should not integrate with the Web service?

00:02:31.335 --> 00:02:33.965
I'd like you to take some time to think it over.

00:02:33.965 --> 00:02:38.765
Research some real life use cases online and then write about it in the following quiz.

00:02:38.764 --> 00:02:41.569
Doing so will better prepare you the next time

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.599
that you're presented with the blockchain and a Web service.

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:47.329
Next up, let's understand how

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.570
the private blockchain that you built will integrate with the Web service.
