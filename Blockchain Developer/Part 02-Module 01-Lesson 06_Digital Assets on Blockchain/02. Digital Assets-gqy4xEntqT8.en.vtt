00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.250
Welcome to this section on Digital Assets.

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.359
To develop this in future lessons,

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.690
we'll start to work a lot with digital assets.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.685
Before getting started, we wanted to help define what these actually are,

00:00:11.685 --> 00:00:13.859
and why they're important to the blockchain.

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:18.254
Understanding how digital assets work on the blockchain will allow you to create

00:00:18.254 --> 00:00:23.479
an entirely new set of applications whose scope goes far beyond simple transactions.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.205
From movies and music,

00:00:25.204 --> 00:00:27.369
to business and legal documentation,

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.005
there's a lot to get excited about in this space.

00:00:30.004 --> 00:00:33.725
With that in mind, let's look a bit more into Digital Asset.

00:00:33.725 --> 00:00:36.840
First, a digital asset can be a lot of things.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.990
But overall, we consider it to be

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.910
both digitally stored content or an online account owned by an individual.

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:47.844
These are valuable because it allows us to take things like books, songs,

00:00:47.844 --> 00:00:49.939
or videos and access them online,

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:52.324
rather than needing to create them physically.

00:00:52.325 --> 00:00:54.980
This is something most of us deal with every day,

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:56.949
so it's not too surprising.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.060
Something I was interested by,

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.135
is that accounts are actually considered digital assets too.

00:01:02.134 --> 00:01:04.560
In this case, something like a bank account,

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.424
a subscription, or a membership could be considered a digital asset.

00:01:08.424 --> 00:01:10.739
So, digital assets are common,

00:01:10.739 --> 00:01:12.084
but what's not is common,

00:01:12.084 --> 00:01:14.390
is understanding exactly what they are,

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.655
and how we can work with them programmatically.

00:01:16.655 --> 00:01:20.930
You'll probably recognize files like GIF, JPEG, and MP3.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.920
There's many other types of digital assets ranging across topics shown here,

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.635
like images, video, 3D files, and many more.

00:01:28.635 --> 00:01:31.344
To help us transmit these files online,

00:01:31.344 --> 00:01:33.984
they're usually compressed and optimized.

00:01:33.984 --> 00:01:37.010
A compression algorithm is any algorithm made

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.060
specifically to achieve a very fast transmission rate,

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.655
or a small amount of storage space.

00:01:42.655 --> 00:01:46.530
These algorithms are used on digital assets to help us store,

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.310
send, and load assets as we work with them.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.859
But, even with these compression algorithms,

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:55.135
the blockchain isn't really the best place to store these files.

00:01:55.135 --> 00:01:59.564
While it's possible, it can be pretty slow and expensive because as we've seen,

00:01:59.564 --> 00:02:04.564
the blockchain as a database suffers from issues with the cost and speed of storage.

00:02:04.564 --> 00:02:06.924
What the blockchain can do very well,

00:02:06.924 --> 00:02:10.865
is help improve the way we manage the ownership of these digital assets.

00:02:10.865 --> 00:02:14.930
This is something that has been a struggle in the past for many industries,

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.075
and is where the blockchain really shines.

00:02:17.074 --> 00:02:19.500
Even with licensing and copyrights,

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.379
Digital assets traditionally have issues with theft,

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:26.764
payments, and royalties associated with the ownership of digital rights.

00:02:26.764 --> 00:02:31.509
The blockchain handles this issue in the same way it handles transactions.

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:33.745
The difference is, instead of saying,

00:02:33.745 --> 00:02:35.439
"Who owns this transaction?"

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:38.039
we're asking, "Who owns this asset?"

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:40.314
It's a simple concept and theory,

00:02:40.314 --> 00:02:42.694
but extremely helpful in practice.

00:02:42.694 --> 00:02:46.549
Coming up, we'll add on a few new ideas to what you already know,

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.920
to help get you set up to manage the ownership of

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:51.889
digital assets using your own private blockchain.

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:55.154
So, that's it. We looked at what a digital asset is,

00:02:55.155 --> 00:02:56.604
went over a few examples,

00:02:56.604 --> 00:03:00.319
and have a basic idea of how digital assets were on the blockchain.

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.479
Coming up, we'll start our journey into

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:05.489
digital assets by reviewing the basics of encoding,

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.080
decoding, and starting to work with them for ourselves.
