00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.384
Hey, and welcome to this introduction to Express js.

00:00:03.384 --> 00:00:07.754
In this video, we'll start taking a deeper look at the Express js Framework.

00:00:07.754 --> 00:00:11.070
We've already gone over a little about what it is and what it helps with.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.290
So, in this section,

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:16.539
we'll mostly focus on getting you connected to the resources you'll need to get started.

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.184
To start, head back to expressjs.com.

00:00:20.184 --> 00:00:21.714
Like we saw before,

00:00:21.714 --> 00:00:23.495
they pitched themselves as a fast,

00:00:23.495 --> 00:00:27.525
unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.

00:00:27.524 --> 00:00:29.114
To break this down a bit,

00:00:29.114 --> 00:00:31.500
opinionated would mean that the framework has

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.719
strict guidelines or best practices that you're meant to follow.

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:36.769
Unopinionated means that you have

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.460
more flexibility to operate outside of these types of guidelines.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.160
Minimalist describes that the code has been written concisely and efficiently.

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:48.539
This video to the right gives a great overview of the history,

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.449
purpose, and goals of the framework.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.955
Watching this video is a great way to learn a few extra details about Express.

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:57.695
Next, it shows you how to install Express.

00:00:57.695 --> 00:01:00.825
You can do this using npm install express.

00:01:00.825 --> 00:01:03.685
All this command is saying is Node Package Manager,

00:01:03.685 --> 00:01:09.004
install Express and save it to my package.json file as a dependency for my project.

00:01:09.004 --> 00:01:12.019
We'll be doing this soon when you build your own project.

00:01:12.019 --> 00:01:13.644
Down at the bottom of the page,

00:01:13.644 --> 00:01:16.359
it goes over a few of the main features of Express.

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:18.420
It helps easily create APIs,

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.435
provide some web application features,

00:01:20.435 --> 00:01:23.754
and has been used as the foundation for many other frameworks.

00:01:23.754 --> 00:01:27.010
Finally, to view Express resources and documentation,

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.295
the top menu bar is a great place to start.

00:01:29.295 --> 00:01:32.734
Here, you'll see documentation like getting started, guides,

00:01:32.734 --> 00:01:36.495
API references, advanced topics, and other resources.

00:01:36.495 --> 00:01:40.689
We'll be working through some of this documentation throughout the rest of this section.

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:43.129
Before we do this, check out the text below to

00:01:43.129 --> 00:01:45.459
help get things organized and when you're ready,

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:49.469
we'll start working through this and creating our "Hello World" application with Express.
