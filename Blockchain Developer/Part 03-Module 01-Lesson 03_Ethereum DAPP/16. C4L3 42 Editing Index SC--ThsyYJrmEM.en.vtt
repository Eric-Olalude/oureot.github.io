00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.355
So, now that we have created the contract,

00:00:02.355 --> 00:00:04.995
we also have tested it against many use cases.

00:00:04.995 --> 00:00:08.460
Let's now create a very simple front-end to interact with the contract.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.415
This is going to be very similar to what we did in version one.

00:00:11.414 --> 00:00:13.769
Let's write a simple front-end for our Dapp.

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.035
Now, remember the Truffle box that we installed,

00:00:16.035 --> 00:00:17.500
the Webpack we installed?

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.105
It already came with bunch of sample front-end code for the initial contract.

00:00:21.105 --> 00:00:22.769
So, if you go in your app folder,

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.199
in the index dot html file and the js or

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.349
the script file is coming from the scripts folder index dot js,

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.390
so I'm going to have to edit these two files.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.490
Let's look at the index dot html first.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.120
Of course, you can go delete everything or just modify it to create your own patterns.

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:39.195
I'm very simple, I'm just going to add my own code here.

00:00:39.195 --> 00:00:43.100
So again, a very simple, the html page absolutely nothing fancy here.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.679
We're starting with getting the script file app dot js,

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:48.619
this comes from all the script files in the script folder right there,

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:50.599
and we'll look at that shortly.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.064
Then, we're giving it a title and some headings here.

00:00:53.064 --> 00:00:55.859
The StarNotary Token DAPP is the heading that we're giving it,

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:58.515
and then we're creating a label for the starName, starId.

00:00:58.515 --> 00:01:03.155
So, anyone can create a star by putting in whatever name they wanted to give a starId.

00:01:03.155 --> 00:01:07.129
Then, calling a functional script to create a star when the button is clicked, okay?

00:01:07.129 --> 00:01:09.494
So, on click we call this function App dot createStar.

00:01:09.495 --> 00:01:12.219
So, I'm going to keep this front-end very simple, and of course,

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:15.530
we're going to ask you to add more functionality to this page as a part

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.829
of your project five but this is what an html front-end looks like.

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:21.760
For our version two, we're very simple for now version.
