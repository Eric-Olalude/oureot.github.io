00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.029
Okay. So, now we've written the contract, everything looks good.

00:00:03.029 --> 00:00:04.379
We have called on the functions,

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:06.570
we've made sure that we've implemented creates star,

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:07.950
put up star, we're but a star.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.039
We're also using our interface definition,

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:13.589
so that we can actually call this token ERC721 token contract.

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:16.739
So, we've done that. Now, let's go see if everything works fine.

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:20.424
A contract is ready now, so we're going to go to a migrations folder.

00:00:20.425 --> 00:00:23.880
Let's have this one, this is the one that we're using.

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:26.429
So, again this came at the boilerplate code, I'm just going to delete it.

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:28.245
We've done this already in a version one,

00:00:28.245 --> 00:00:29.894
and this is all we need to do.

00:00:29.894 --> 00:00:34.240
Okay. So, again, we'll just use artifacts that required the JSON format.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.050
So, we need this, of the smart contract,

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:37.489
and then we deploy it like this.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.715
Now, let's go compiler contract and make sure everything compiles fine.

00:00:40.715 --> 00:00:42.790
So, I'm going to go back to my terminal.

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:45.750
So, I'm in my starNotaryv2 right now.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.409
Let's go and see if everything works fine.

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:50.379
So, I'm not in my console right now,

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.910
that's the reason I have to give the command truffle but I can just go truffle develop.

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:55.579
Then, go inside, and then that's when you

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:57.679
don't have to use the word truffle but I'm outside right now.

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:00.109
So, I'm just going to say truffle compiler.

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:01.339
Hopefully, I saved the file.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.695
Let's go save all these files again,

00:01:03.695 --> 00:01:05.739
make sure they're really saved.

00:01:05.739 --> 00:01:09.254
Okay. Going back to my terminal again, truffle compile.

00:01:09.254 --> 00:01:12.884
Let's see if the compilation of the contract goes okay.

00:01:12.885 --> 00:01:14.820
Fantastic. It went through,

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:15.959
no errors came through,

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:17.584
so now we know everything is working.

00:01:17.584 --> 00:01:19.299
Now, let's go see what video in the next step.

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:22.069
We're actually going to start deploying it to the test node to work,

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:24.109
and then we'll also start going to write a test.

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:27.394
Then, we will also create a simple front-end page for this,

00:01:27.394 --> 00:01:30.479
a smart contract to create a complete DApp.
