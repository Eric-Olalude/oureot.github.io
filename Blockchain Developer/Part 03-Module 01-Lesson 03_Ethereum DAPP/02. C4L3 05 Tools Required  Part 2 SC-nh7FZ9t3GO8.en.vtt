00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
Okay. So, we saw that in the last video,

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.580
we were actually doing an unbox web part,

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.830
you unbox a complete boilerplate code that we're using.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.830
Once we're done with that, it's going to complete takes about a minute or so.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.234
So, that was Truffle boxes tools that we used,

00:00:13.234 --> 00:00:15.509
and then now we're also going to use the MetaMask.

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.699
Again, you should already have MetaMask installed.

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.144
So, let's go make sure that we have MetaMask installed.

00:00:20.144 --> 00:00:22.859
Okay. So, if you look on a browser window on the side,

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.300
one of these things that comes up,

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.250
that is to make sure that you have MetaMask installed.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.004
If you don't have MetaMask installed,

00:00:28.004 --> 00:00:31.844
you can just go to your app store and download MetaMask, that's it.

00:00:31.844 --> 00:00:35.399
So again, MetaMask is something that we use to connect our back end,

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.079
with the local Ethereum network.

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.469
So, remember, once we installed or run the Truffle develop command,

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.615
it actually starts local development console,

00:00:42.615 --> 00:00:43.850
Ethereum network for you.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.710
Now, to connect that to the front end,

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.359
that is what MetaMask does, okay.

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:49.789
So, you're going to go to MetaMask and make sure if that's installed.

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:51.530
In fact, let me show you. I'm actually going to go run

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.530
the Truffle development console first.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.370
Okay. So now, we have everything set up.

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:56.689
If you saw and I'm going to go run it.

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:59.044
So, if you see I'm actually inside my directory,

00:00:59.045 --> 00:01:00.469
in case I'm inside the directory I made,

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.814
and inside the directory also unbox the Truffle Webpack.

00:01:03.814 --> 00:01:05.944
Now, I'm going to actually run the development console,

00:01:05.944 --> 00:01:07.069
that actually what this does,

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:09.439
it actually starts a local Ethereum network for you,

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:13.319
so let's go run that. Okay, fantastic.

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:16.319
If you see it gave you 10 accounts to deal with 10 private keys,

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:17.704
also that also come along with it.

00:01:17.704 --> 00:01:20.969
Now, if you see it also gives you, it actually starts Truffle on this port, okay?

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:24.299
So, that's the port number that Truffle is running out of the Ethereum network.

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.829
So, I'm going to copy this and this is what we'll use to connect our two MetaMasks,

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:30.390
so let's go back to our MetaMask now.

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:34.424
So, that's the MetaMask, so I'm going to go click right there.

00:01:34.424 --> 00:01:37.399
So, if you see this is the dropdown menu for connecting to other networks,

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.870
I'm connected to Rinkeby right now.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.850
So, let's go connect to a private network.

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:42.409
I've already have that, but if you don't have that,

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.200
just go to Custom RPC.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.189
Then, you're going to enter that URL,

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.849
that Truffle develop gave you and I'm going to hit save.

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:54.875
Of course, it's going to ask you to reload because it's reconnecting to everything again.

00:01:54.875 --> 00:01:58.939
Let's go back to a MetaMask and you'll see it's connected to a private network,

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:00.319
and this is how it starts up.

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:04.009
Also, wanted to let you know you can also import your account, okay?

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.425
The way you do that, go to your terminal,

00:02:06.424 --> 00:02:08.530
if you see all these accounts right here,

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.235
and all these private keys at right here.

00:02:10.235 --> 00:02:11.420
So, I'm going to in fact show you.

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:12.949
Let me go pick a private.

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:15.530
I'm going to just pick up because I think I've already imported the first ones.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.215
Let me pick up one of these ones,

00:02:17.215 --> 00:02:20.479
and I'm going to show you how you can import your accounts into MetaMask.

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:22.549
So, what you do, is you get the private key of the account

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.860
that you want to import. Copied it.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.630
So, let's go back to a MetaMask.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.270
I'm going to say, I want to import an account.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.450
So, I'm going to say, "Import account".

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:36.359
I'm going to paste my assays to paste to private key right there.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.700
I'm going to paste my private key, then I say, "Hit import."

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:42.919
Fantastic. So, if you see this account address that it pulled up, the d one.

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:44.269
If you look at this address right there,

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.755
the d one and the account for,

00:02:45.754 --> 00:02:48.319
this should match with the private key that we had.

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:49.669
So, see if it's d one.

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:52.159
So, number 4 and that's number 4 again this private key.

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:54.770
So, this is how you get MetaMask, everything all set up.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.560
The last tool we're going to be using is Infura.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.520
Again, you already should have Infura set up.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.670
Again, we're not going to use Infura for our lesson,

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:04.129
but you will need this setup for your project.

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:05.810
If you don't really remember,

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.939
you know how you've set up Infura or if you'd not sure,

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:11.569
but you should have, I'm actually going to give a link to one of the lessons.

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.729
We covered that in course four in one of the lessons,

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:14.824
solidity we can borrow.

00:03:14.824 --> 00:03:16.639
Couldn't be in detail on how to set up Infura,

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:19.979
I'm going to give a link to that lesson right below this video.
