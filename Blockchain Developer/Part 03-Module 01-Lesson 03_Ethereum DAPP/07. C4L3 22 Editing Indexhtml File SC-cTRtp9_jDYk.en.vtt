00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
So now, that we've written our smart contract,

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.229
we've also written some test cases to make sure that it's working fine using more [inaudible].

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.900
Let's now write a simple front end for a DApp.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.089
Now, with the Truffle box that we installed,

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:14.820
it already came with a bunch of HTML boilerplate code,

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.655
like the HTML page and the corresponding JavaScript file.

00:00:17.655 --> 00:00:20.970
If you look over here, all these folders we looked at the contract's folder.

00:00:20.969 --> 00:00:23.070
We looked at the migrations for little test folder.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.440
There's another folder right here called app.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.775
Within app, you will see that there's a scripts folder.

00:00:29.774 --> 00:00:32.460
If you go into scripts, there's an index.js file,

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.480
and then we also have an index.html file right there.

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:39.334
So what we typically have to do is edit these two files.

00:00:39.335 --> 00:00:41.655
Let's go first to the index.html files.

00:00:41.655 --> 00:00:43.325
Everything is in the app folder.

00:00:43.325 --> 00:00:45.800
There is a scripts folder that has the index.js

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:48.574
file that a script that's the index.html will require.

00:00:48.575 --> 00:00:50.980
So, we're looking at the index.html file.

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:54.569
Now, of course, you can pretty much look at this one, what it's doing.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.369
It's pretty simple. It's having a table.

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:59.390
Now, this is where the existing web pack module

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.630
that we installed that came with some boilerplate code.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.040
I'm just going to delete this and just add my own.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.840
Then, I'm also going to give you this code below this video.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.540
I'm just going to use this.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.950
So, again, just exactly the way it was going

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.769
a very simple HTML page over here and nothing fancy.

00:01:15.769 --> 00:01:18.289
We are getting a script file, the app.js.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.420
This comes from all the script files that are located in

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.704
the scripts folder and we will look at that file shortly,

00:01:23.704 --> 00:01:25.629
and then we're giving it a title;

00:01:25.629 --> 00:01:28.584
the StarNotary DAPP Front End.

00:01:28.584 --> 00:01:31.729
Then, within that, we're also having some headings over here.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.730
Then, we're also having a CSS file, the style sheet.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.760
Again, this is all something that just came along and that makes

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.090
the truffle boxes really easy to use because it kind of a lot of boilerplate codes.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.510
You can really focus on the coding part and the block,

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.890
and in the theory and part than just putting too much time into CSS and that stuff.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.385
We're also creating a label for the starName,

00:01:50.385 --> 00:01:53.920
and then calling a function in a script file to get the starName.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.225
So, we're creating a label and then we're calling a function.

00:01:56.224 --> 00:02:00.530
When this button is clicks on click is just a function that when onClick happens,

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.885
you're calling a function called starName,

00:02:02.885 --> 00:02:05.335
and this is coming from an index.js file.

00:02:05.334 --> 00:02:08.555
The same thing is happening with the starOwner over here too.

00:02:08.555 --> 00:02:11.300
We're having a starOwner, and then we're having another button to claim the star,

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.010
so we just have three buttons on the page,

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:14.299
and this is what will look like.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.835
So, that's the index.html.

00:02:15.835 --> 00:02:18.290
Let's look at the index.js in our next video and

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:21.929
modify that and then we can start running a front end of the application.
