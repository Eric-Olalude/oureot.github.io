00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.339
Okay, let's get started writing our test.

00:00:02.339 --> 00:00:04.169
One thing I wanted to mention in Truffle,

00:00:04.169 --> 00:00:06.179
anytime you're writing any test files,

00:00:06.179 --> 00:00:09.404
they have always to be located in the test directory.

00:00:09.404 --> 00:00:12.809
So, if you look in my project folders StarNotary version one, V1.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.195
We also looked at the contracts folder.

00:00:15.195 --> 00:00:17.339
We've already looked at the Migrations folder,

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:19.035
where we had the migrations file written,

00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:21.510
this one, and now we're looking at the test folder.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.540
Now, all the test files that you want truffle to test,

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.114
when you run the command truffle tests,

00:00:26.114 --> 00:00:28.529
have to be located in this directory,

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.410
and also they need to be ending in the extension.js.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.380
Okay? So, now let's go look at RGS file.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.210
Now, if you look at the very first line,

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.344
so first of all I wanted to mention a very simple,

00:00:38.344 --> 00:00:39.710
just one test written for now.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.450
We're going to walk through it in quite a bit of detail,

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.010
but let's look at the first line for now.

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:45.109
You might be wondering why do we need this.

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:49.640
Just the way you backpack is the truffle box where webpack that we used is set up.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.009
You might get a re-generator error if you don't use this or import this.

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:55.609
You can try it with or without.

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:57.979
I've seen both ways you know based upon the version of

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:00.724
the webpack that you installed at the time you're following this class.

00:01:00.725 --> 00:01:03.410
So if you don't get this error, you can always ignore it,

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:06.979
just combing it out, but I've personally seen based upon the version,

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.960
and sometimes I just randomly get this error,

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:11.149
typically what it does is that it just brings in

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.260
some extra modules that you'll need to regenerate your files.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.320
So try importing it and that should definitely get rid of the error.

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:18.739
So once you have that now,

00:01:18.739 --> 00:01:20.795
next thing if you look at this line,

00:01:20.795 --> 00:01:23.989
the StarNotary artifacts.requires, starNotary.sol.

00:01:23.989 --> 00:01:27.469
Now, before we start writing any of the tests, what do we need?

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:29.474
We need the contract JSON representation,

00:01:29.474 --> 00:01:30.719
so we can call functions in it.

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:32.859
It is not what testing is all about so we can

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:35.469
call the functions and make sure that they're behaving the way they should.

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:38.469
So that means we need the contract JSON representation.

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:40.734
This is called the contract abstraction.

00:01:40.734 --> 00:01:44.049
Contract abstractions are the only way or the basis for

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.424
making contract interaction possible from your JavaScript tests.

00:01:47.424 --> 00:01:50.739
So now we need to ask for those contracts explicitly.

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:53.289
Truffle has done a lot of heavy lifting for

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.035
us by allowing us to use truffle artifacts library.

00:01:56.034 --> 00:01:59.840
So the artifact is basically just a JSON representation of the contract,

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.719
from the truffle compile command that regenerate.

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:04.909
Now we can usually see that all of the contract and

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.250
JSON format under the Build Contracts folder.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.330
So just like you know,

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.760
you want to go explore what's going on,

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.090
if you go in the Build folder,

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.594
if you go under the contracts folder,

00:02:13.594 --> 00:02:16.060
this is where you see when you run the compile commands,

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.974
all the JSON files gets stored here.

00:02:17.974 --> 00:02:21.489
So all we're doing is we're requiring that in our test files,

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.060
we can actually have the abstraction,

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.479
so we can actually start writing and calling methods.

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:29.014
Okay, so again we do this by doing artifacts.require method.

00:02:29.014 --> 00:02:30.879
A method that is provided by truffle,

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:32.585
that allows us to request

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:36.289
a usable contract abstraction for a specific sort of the deep contract,

00:02:36.288 --> 00:02:38.139
from this folder that I just showed you.

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:41.769
All we're doing here is getting the JSON representation of the contract.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.960
Remember we used artifacts.require in the migrations file to deploy the contract, right?

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.260
Now, using artifacts.require within

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:51.609
the tests works exactly the same way as it is within the migration.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.750
So you just need to pass the name of the contract.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.264
You write this and that's just the way.

00:02:55.264 --> 00:02:58.759
In fact, let me show you the migration file that we had initially.

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:01.294
So let me in fact pull up the right migrations file. This is the one.

00:03:01.294 --> 00:03:04.519
So remember we also require the artifacts so it could deploy it,

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.985
exactly same way works in this case too.

00:03:06.985 --> 00:03:09.230
Okay. So going back to our test file again.

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:12.304
So that's a test file, we're requiring the artifacts and that's it.

00:03:12.305 --> 00:03:13.420
So in our next video,

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:16.544
let me walk you through our very simple test.

00:03:16.544 --> 00:03:17.655
The [inaudible] testing.

00:03:17.655 --> 00:03:19.729
If the name of the contract is set to

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:22.039
Udacity Star that we did in the constructor of the function.

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:24.900
So let's look at that in our next video.
