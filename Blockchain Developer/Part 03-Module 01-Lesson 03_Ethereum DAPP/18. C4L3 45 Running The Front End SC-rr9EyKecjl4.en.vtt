00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.495
So, now that we have our smart contract written, we have tested it,

00:00:03.495 --> 00:00:06.689
we have also created our simple front-end page using

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.080
index.html and index.js, everything is fantastic.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.304
All is set up. Now, let's go run our back-end and our front-end,

00:00:13.304 --> 00:00:15.150
and see what our app looks like.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.475
This is all that we did on version one, course two.

00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:19.020
So, I have my terminal window open.

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.475
I'm going to have two tabs here,

00:00:20.475 --> 00:00:23.115
one for running my front-end and other for running my back-end,

00:00:23.114 --> 00:00:24.599
or my front-end, back-end.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.429
This is the folder that I'm in,

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:28.125
my contract where everything exists,

00:00:28.125 --> 00:00:30.839
all my migration files and all my contract files,

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:32.789
and also my front-end files are right there.

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:34.875
So, for running the back-end,

00:00:34.875 --> 00:00:38.469
I'm going to have to command truffle develop.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.039
That starts my local private Ethereum network on my computer.

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:44.509
Great. So, if you scroll on the top,

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:46.429
you'll see it's running at this code.

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:50.314
Make sure this is the port that your MetaMask is connected to.

00:00:50.314 --> 00:00:53.899
If you go to MetaMask, go to private network and put this URL,

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.879
and this is how you connect to your private Ethereum network for using MetaMask.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.780
If you also need to import any account,

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.039
if you haven't done so already,

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.244
you can always pick any of these private keys.

00:01:03.244 --> 00:01:06.064
Once you do that, go to MetaMask, import the account.

00:01:06.064 --> 00:01:07.969
I know we've already done that quite a bit many times,

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:11.045
and then you want to pick accountable and get imported into your MetaMask.

00:01:11.045 --> 00:01:13.219
Okay. So, I'm going to also go compile

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:16.209
the contract again to make sure everything works still fine.

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:20.059
Mask is going to go test to my contract to make sure everything still works fine.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.019
Then, I'm going to go migrate my contract on my local network,

00:01:24.019 --> 00:01:25.950
that is running using my reset flag.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.769
Make sure you have a fresh copy.

00:01:27.769 --> 00:01:29.989
Great. Now, what this all says,

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:33.679
is that your local Ethereum network is running and your contract is done.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.670
Notary is now existing with an instance of the contract at this specific address.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.640
So, we're all set. Okay. That's the back-end,

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.650
everything is nice and set.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.505
Now, let's go to my other terminal window, run up front-end.

00:01:43.504 --> 00:01:46.929
This is running by using the command npm run dev.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.940
Now, all these commands are coming from a packaged.json file.

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:51.125
You can always go and look at it.

00:01:51.125 --> 00:01:53.135
This is how webpack is already set up.

00:01:53.135 --> 00:01:55.190
So, I'm going to run that. Now, this starts

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:58.709
my webpack development server on my front-end at this point.

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:00.044
Great. So, I'm going to copy this,

00:02:00.045 --> 00:02:01.379
I'm going to go to my browser.

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:03.929
So, my back-end running at port 9545,

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.015
front-end running at port 8080.

00:02:06.015 --> 00:02:13.139
Let's go back to our browser and let's go paste as front-end code URL here, and great.

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:15.059
So, this is the front-end what it looks like.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.275
That's my MetaMask.

00:02:16.275 --> 00:02:20.655
Make sure your MetaMask is connected and you're connected to your private network,

00:02:20.655 --> 00:02:22.199
and you also have these accounts

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:24.409
imported and all that stuff. So, everything is all set up.

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:26.359
I'm connected to my port 9545,

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.080
which is my local Ethereum network.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.800
Now, that's what the front-end looks like.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.080
Great. A simple front-end I ever designed.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.725
Of course, we're going to have you design a little bit more features in our project.

00:02:35.724 --> 00:02:38.639
Moving on. So, let's go try and run this transaction.

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:40.529
I'm going to say, I'm going give a star,

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.810
but let's give it a name, TEST.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.210
Then, I'm going to give it, you can pick any idea. I'm going to give it five.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.790
Okay. So, now we're going to go create star and we have,

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:52.819
I just started with a star and I'm just going to go give it a star name,

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.609
give it a star ID, and now let's hit to the transaction submit.

00:02:57.289 --> 00:03:00.044
In fact, this error comes up.

00:03:00.044 --> 00:03:01.319
I wanted to show you this error,

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:02.435
this is a NaNs error.

00:03:02.435 --> 00:03:04.324
It's nice that it came up right now.

00:03:04.324 --> 00:03:07.729
So, I'm gonna go to MetaMask and show you how to clear this error.

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:08.869
So, go to your MetaMask,

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.080
go to your settings.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.110
It just gives this NaNs error sometimes,

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.575
all you have to do is reset your account.

00:03:15.574 --> 00:03:20.469
Once you have that, I'm going to go refresh my window again.

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:22.574
Okay. So, everything is all set.

00:03:22.574 --> 00:03:23.729
It just gives us NaNs errors,

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:26.889
sometimes MetaMask just gets a little confused.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.870
Okay. So, let's go to a MetaMask right there,

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.134
and then I'm going to go hit submit.

00:03:33.134 --> 00:03:35.669
Fantastic. So, the transaction has been confirmed.

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:37.859
Again, I wanted to mention, if you ever get a NaNs error just go to

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.995
your MetaMask settings and clear the NaNs error, and the error goes away.

00:03:40.995 --> 00:03:43.719
So, now we have a star existing with the name TEST,

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:45.844
it has a token ID of five.

00:03:45.844 --> 00:03:48.289
Great, fantastic. So, that's what a front-end looks like.

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:50.629
Congratulations. You have a complete app that you've

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:53.479
created here with a very simple front-end, back-end.

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:56.060
We're all communicating nice and good altogether.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.219
So, that's how you create your depths.
