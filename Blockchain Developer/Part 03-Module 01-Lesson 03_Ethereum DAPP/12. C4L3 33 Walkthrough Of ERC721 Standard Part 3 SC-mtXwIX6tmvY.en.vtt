00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
Now, ERC-721 also provides three events that should be implemented,

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.000
so we have three events even approval,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.334
even approval for all,

00:00:07.334 --> 00:00:09.164
and then the event of transfer, okay.

00:00:09.164 --> 00:00:13.709
So, these are the three functions that events are fired whenever a contract calls them.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.940
They're broadcasted to any listening programs, once they're fired.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.490
Outside programs can listen to the blockchain events,

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:22.889
so that they can execute logic once the event is

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.469
fired using the information that the event provides.

00:00:25.469 --> 00:00:27.884
So, we have three events here, the transfer event.

00:00:27.885 --> 00:00:30.990
Now, this event is fired whenever a token changes hands.

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:35.339
It's broadcasted when a token's ownership moves from one user to another user.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.025
It details which account sent the token,

00:00:38.024 --> 00:00:39.734
which account received the token,

00:00:39.734 --> 00:00:42.269
and what was the token ID that was transferred.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.785
So, that's a transfer event, and then we have the event approval.

00:00:45.784 --> 00:00:50.974
This event is fired whenever a user approved another user to take ownership of a token,

00:00:50.975 --> 00:00:53.950
for example, whenever approved function is executed.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.100
It details which account currently owns the token,

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.850
which account is allowed to own the token and future,

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.760
and also which token or by ID is approved to have ownership transferred.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.984
Then, we have the event approval for all,

00:01:06.984 --> 00:01:08.609
this event should be emitted,

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:11.810
when an operator is enabled or disabled by an owner.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.870
Now, this is how it's implemented or were supposed to implement using the interface.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.670
Again, we can always go and write all these functions and events ourselves,

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.879
but again, like I said, we use an ERC-20 standard.

00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:24.243
We just use OpenZeppelin,

00:01:24.243 --> 00:01:25.655
we've already implemented that,

00:01:25.655 --> 00:01:28.879
and so let's walk through how we can import this into our contract,

00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:33.724
and make our tokens standardized based upon ERC-2721,

00:01:33.724 --> 00:01:36.959
if we could just use OpenZeppelins on the contracts.
