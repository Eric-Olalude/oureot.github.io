00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.569
ERC-721 is an ERC standard that describes

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:07.394
how to build non-fungible or unique tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

00:00:07.394 --> 00:00:10.830
ERC-721 defines a minimum interface,

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.199
a smart contract must implement and allow

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:16.050
unique tokens to be managed, owned, and treated.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.815
It does not restrict adding additional supplemental functions.

00:00:19.815 --> 00:00:24.900
Now, like ERC-721 or ERC-20 tokens that we learned in the course in validity,

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:26.144
this is an interface.

00:00:26.144 --> 00:00:28.230
So, if you see this is an interface definition,

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.675
which means it describes what it should to do,

00:00:30.675 --> 00:00:32.174
not how it should do.

00:00:32.174 --> 00:00:35.789
Implementation is also lift upon the smart contract right.

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:41.189
Now, ERC-721 defines a set of functions and events that involve the movement,

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:44.000
ownership, and information about these non-fungible items.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.039
So, we have function's name,

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:47.225
we have the name of the token,

00:00:47.225 --> 00:00:49.880
we have symbol, then we have total supply,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.935
balance of, owner of, approval.

00:00:51.935 --> 00:00:54.530
Look at the list and we also have three events defined here.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.660
So, let's look at some of the functions on the screen.

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:00.544
Now, some of the functions are like ERC-20 functions.

00:01:00.545 --> 00:01:01.820
The reason it's done that,

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.424
just to saw that we can have compliance between the ERC-20 and the ERC-721.

00:01:06.424 --> 00:01:11.439
It makes it easier for existing wallets to display simple information about the token.

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:14.569
Then, we start with the first of all with the name of the token.

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:16.279
This function is used to tell

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.835
the outside contract and applications with the name of this token is,

00:01:19.834 --> 00:01:21.214
and then we have the symbol.

00:01:21.215 --> 00:01:26.750
Again, just so that we have compatibility between the ERC-20 and ERC-721 token standards,

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.415
and then we have total supply.

00:01:28.415 --> 00:01:32.900
This function returns the total number of tokens available on the blockchain.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.435
The supply of course, does not have to be constant.

00:01:35.435 --> 00:01:37.625
Then, we have the balance of function.

00:01:37.625 --> 00:01:39.890
This function is just right there, the balance of function.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.140
This function is used to find the balance

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.560
or the number of tokens at a given address owns.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.885
Okay? So, that's some of the functions that we have ownerOf function.

00:01:47.885 --> 00:01:49.640
This ownerOf function that we're looking at,

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.284
this function returns the address of the owner of a token.

00:01:53.284 --> 00:01:57.634
Because each ERC-721 token is non-fungible and therefore,

00:01:57.635 --> 00:01:58.915
it has unique ID.

00:01:58.915 --> 00:02:01.910
So, it is a reference on the blockchain via this unique ID.

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.359
So, we can determine if the owner of the token using its ID,

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:06.819
and if it's the right owner or not.

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:10.319
Okay? So, let's look at some more functions in our next video.
