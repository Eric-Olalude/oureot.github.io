00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.620
In the previous videos,

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.875
we created the version one of the star notary contract.

00:00:04.875 --> 00:00:08.640
This time, we will write the second version of this contract by

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.450
using open zeppelins ERC 7-21 interface.

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:17.265
Now ERC 7-21 is a standard to make non-fungible tokens.

00:00:17.265 --> 00:00:20.250
To fully appreciate why we chose to make our contract,

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.109
a non-fungible token asset,

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.879
it is worth understanding the difference between fungible and non-fungible.

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:28.695
When something is fungible,

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:30.160
in this case a token,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.630
it means it can be easily replaced by something

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.825
identical and it is interchangeable with ease.

00:00:35.825 --> 00:00:37.609
Real-world examples of something

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:40.030
fungible could include the five dollar bill in your pocket.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.520
So, if you were to lend that five dollar to someone else,

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.790
it really wouldn't matter if they did not return the same exact one.

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:50.704
Now, this all changes when something is non-fungible.

00:00:50.704 --> 00:00:54.649
Although two items may look a like or same at a glance,

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.500
each will have unique information or attributes

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.664
that make them irreplaceable or impossible to swap.

00:01:00.664 --> 00:01:04.745
One physical example of a non-fungible asset could be a plane ticket.

00:01:04.745 --> 00:01:07.219
Sure they look alike as all the other tickets,

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:09.515
but each one has a different passenger name,

00:01:09.515 --> 00:01:13.010
destination, departure times and seat numbers.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.330
Exchanging yours with someone else is just not going to make any sense.

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:19.584
While most tokens are fungible,

00:01:19.584 --> 00:01:22.849
which means every token is same as every other token,

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:25.699
ERC 7-21 tokens are all unique.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.454
Think of them like rare,

00:01:27.454 --> 00:01:29.435
one of a kind collectibles.

00:01:29.435 --> 00:01:32.269
If you're making some sort of game on Ethereum,

00:01:32.269 --> 00:01:36.140
then you are most probably looking to use the non-fungible standard.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.875
CryptoKitties, Magic cards are some of the famous ones.

00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:42.890
You can tokenize any real world assets.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.700
ERC 7-21 tokens can be used in any exchange,

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.370
but the value is a result of the uniqueness and the rareness associated with each token.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.814
Stars are all unique too,

00:01:54.814 --> 00:01:57.259
no two stars can ever be identical.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.030
So, if you claim a star,

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.109
that star is always unique and no other star will exactly be the same.

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:10.705
Hence we are choosing the ERC 7-21 standard to tokenize our star notary contract.

00:02:10.705 --> 00:02:12.640
So let's get started.
