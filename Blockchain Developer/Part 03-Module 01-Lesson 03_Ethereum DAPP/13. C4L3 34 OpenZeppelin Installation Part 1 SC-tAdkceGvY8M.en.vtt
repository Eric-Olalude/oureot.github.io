00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.508
So, like we did with the ERC-20 standard for used OpenZeppelin,

00:00:03.508 --> 00:00:06.285
we will do the same to create ERC721 tokens.

00:00:06.285 --> 00:00:08.669
Now, OpenZeppelin if you see on the screen right now,

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:11.160
is a library for writing smart contracts on Ethereum.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.789
With OpenZeppelin, you can quickly build your own token contracts.

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:16.839
They have already implemented all these functions.

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:20.559
You can just use some basic parameters and definitions,

00:00:20.559 --> 00:00:22.994
and just use or import one of the token files.

00:00:22.995 --> 00:00:27.839
So, let me show you how OpenZeppelins GitHub page and they've implemented that.

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:29.070
So, if you open up this page,

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.425
you'll see, let me just zoom in a little bit.

00:00:31.425 --> 00:00:33.359
If you go in the contracts folder,

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:34.799
and we did all this process,

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:37.259
going to dib the ERC-20 tokens also.

00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:39.659
So, let's go to token,

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:42.599
and then if you see we have ERC-20 that we use last time,

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.000
and this is ERC721 this time.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.689
So now, let's get started making this version.

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:50.064
So, I'm going to go back to my terminal again.

00:00:50.064 --> 00:00:55.339
So, if you see I'm not in my starNotary version one folder anymore, I'm outside it.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.355
Now, let's go make another folder here or a directory,

00:00:58.354 --> 00:01:00.994
and let's call this a version two.

00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:04.439
Fantastic. Now, let's cd into it.

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.329
So, everything empty for now, there's nothing inside it.

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:10.670
Now, we're going to do a Truffle unbox Webpack,

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.260
and this is exactly what we did.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.359
So, we're creating a directory,

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:15.974
now we're using a webpack Truffle box,

00:01:15.974 --> 00:01:18.484
so that comes with a lot of boilerplate code.

00:01:18.484 --> 00:01:21.319
Then, we can go and change, and edit link just like we did on version one.

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:24.750
So, let's do Truffle unbox webpack.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.200
Now, this takes a little while.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.730
So, let me walk you through some of the contracts while it takes that.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.010
So, let's go look at how this contract is implemented.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.829
I'm going to show you a little bit more detail in the next videos,

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:38.944
but this is how it's implemented right there.

00:01:38.944 --> 00:01:41.059
So, if you see we have mappings here,

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.310
they've implemented all that stuff that we were doing

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.644
on our own if you looked at the basic, this one,

00:01:45.644 --> 00:01:48.769
this interface, but they've implemented all these functions now for us,

00:01:48.769 --> 00:01:50.869
and all we have to do is import this file.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.210
So, we have functions like balance off.

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:54.739
We have owner off,

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:56.390
and then we're going to walk through

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.609
a little bit more detail in some of these functions over here.

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:00.319
But, just broadly going through,

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:02.944
we have getApproved function implemented,

00:02:02.944 --> 00:02:05.969
we have setApprovalForAll function implemented,

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.330
we have isApproved function implemented, and then,

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.020
we also have transferFrom function implemented, safeTransferFrom function.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.310
Remember, we did it two different ways,

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.895
safeTransferFrom one way that does not have the data,

00:02:16.895 --> 00:02:19.909
they've already implemented this and this one accepts the data.

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:21.829
So, all these functions are implemented.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.555
Also, remember, like we said,

00:02:23.555 --> 00:02:27.409
ERC721 standard just tells you what functions you should implement,

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:28.669
but you can always add more.

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:31.954
So, their function that exists to make sure the token exists.

00:02:31.955 --> 00:02:34.080
Then, we also have a function called minting,

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.460
that we were possibly going to use.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.810
We have function called burn, addTokenTo, removeTokenTo.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.030
In fact, functions, the interesting part of

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.314
Solidity of the function definitions are pretty simple.

00:02:44.314 --> 00:02:46.639
Basically, seen functions just a couple lines.

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:49.069
So, go through them and see how much you understand,

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.280
and let's go back and see if it's happened. So, fantastic.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.125
So, everything is all taken care of.

00:02:54.125 --> 00:02:55.340
In the next video,

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.719
I'm actually going to walk you through some of

00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:00.109
these changes and import everything into our directory,

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.040
and see how everything works.
