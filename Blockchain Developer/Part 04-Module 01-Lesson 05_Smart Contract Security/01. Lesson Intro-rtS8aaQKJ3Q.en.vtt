00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
Hey, and welcome to this lesson on smart contract security.

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.445
Smart contract security is a huge and extremely important topic.

00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:11.640
With smart contracts, large amounts of money are being

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.075
handled constantly using programs that anyone can access.

00:00:15.074 --> 00:00:18.509
These smart contracts can't be updated once they're launched,

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.950
and errors in the code can result in hackers getting away with huge amounts of money.

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.559
Now, this isn't meant to scare you away.

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:30.854
The idea is to understand how crucial this is to your career as a blockchain developer.

00:00:30.855 --> 00:00:34.890
Luckily, there is a rapidly developing ecosystem of tools and

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.049
communities that are coming together to help

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:39.989
ensure the security of smart contracts we develop.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.150
Because of the importance of this subject,

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.409
I'll be approaching this lesson a little differently than others.

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:48.229
For one, it's impossible for this lesson to be

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:52.339
the one-stop shop for all things related to smart contract security.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.020
For that reason, I'll focus on pointing you in the right direction,

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.910
and you'll need to continue researching and developing in this field,

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:00.889
so you can always stay up to date.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.280
That said, there is a ton we can go over here.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.810
To start the lesson,

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.445
we'll go over a few well-known attacks that have happened on smart contracts,

00:01:09.444 --> 00:01:12.509
the Parity wallet hack and the DAO attack.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.560
We'll code up versions of the original contracts,

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.960
identify the weaknesses that were exploited,

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:20.404
then hack these systems for ourselves.

00:01:20.405 --> 00:01:24.888
The goal isn't to blame anyone in particular that may have overlooked these errors,

00:01:24.888 --> 00:01:28.655
but to learn from them and ensure that we don't make the same mistakes.

00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:31.280
After this, we'll walk through some resources,

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.575
like the solidity security considerations,

00:01:33.575 --> 00:01:35.390
some coding best practices,

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.575
then take a look at the research and development that has happened in this space.

00:01:39.575 --> 00:01:43.070
Next, we'll look at the tooling ecosystem that is taking

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:46.984
shape to help you make sure contracts you create are safe and secure.

00:01:46.984 --> 00:01:51.019
These tools include things like security audits and bug bounties,

00:01:51.019 --> 00:01:54.035
where companies and other developers take time to try and exploit

00:01:54.034 --> 00:01:57.634
any potential weaknesses in your contract before they are deployed.

00:01:57.635 --> 00:02:01.100
Throughout the lesson, there'll be a series of contract examples,

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:04.669
where you'll be asked to identify the type of vulnerabilities that exist.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.730
This will help you get a good eye for catching these errors and

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.200
hopefully help you not make similar mistakes in your code in the future.

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:12.859
So, with that said,

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.260
I hope you understand the value of the extra reading

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:18.094
and outside resources that come along with this lesson.

00:02:18.094 --> 00:02:21.560
I'll give as much guidance as I can to point you in the right direction,

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.745
and by the end you should be able to stay on top of the latest research in this field.

00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:29.120
This is an extremely valuable skill to have as a developer,

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.474
and you'll continue utilizing all these skills

00:02:31.474 --> 00:02:34.919
for as long as you continue developing smart contracts.
