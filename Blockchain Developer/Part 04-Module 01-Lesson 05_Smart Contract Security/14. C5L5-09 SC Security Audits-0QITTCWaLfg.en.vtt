00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
On top of using secure tools and best practices,

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.464
it's possible to get help from others to help audit your contracts.

00:00:06.464 --> 00:00:08.759
This is really important when first getting started.

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:11.439
But even as you get more familiar with developing contracts,

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:13.814
you should always have them reviewed by others.

00:00:13.814 --> 00:00:16.109
You don't need to go through a full audit process

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.030
for contracts you're just practicing with.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.240
But anything that's going to go live and have real-world consequences,

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:24.059
should definitely go through some type of auditing process.

00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:25.709
This helps for two reasons.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.570
One, you'll have experts reviewing

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.449
your code and providing a list of possible vulnerabilities.

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.979
On top of that, even if you are the expert,

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:35.494
it helps to have a different set of eyes on your contract.

00:00:35.494 --> 00:00:39.829
This helps allow others to catch vulnerabilities that you may have not noticed yourself.

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.530
Even getting review from a friend can be helpful,

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.670
but here I'll go through a few ways that you can get your contract officially audited.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.770
There are many services that do this and

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.960
probably many more that will come up in the future.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.285
But for now, I'll go over Open Zeppelin, CoinFabrik and Quillhash.

00:00:55.284 --> 00:00:59.719
You can get to each of these pages I'll go over using the links placed below the video.

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:01.504
First, Open Zeppelin.

00:01:01.505 --> 00:01:02.840
As you're probably noticing,

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.460
Open Zeppelin comes up a lot.

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:06.589
It's becoming pretty standard practice to

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.870
use the features they provide for your contracts.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.030
On top of all the other things we mentioned,

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.730
they provide security audits for smart contracts.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.740
On this page, you'll see an overview of

00:01:15.739 --> 00:01:18.754
their services but it's likely you won't be using this right away.

00:01:18.754 --> 00:01:22.578
What I do find extremely valuable before getting a contract audited,

00:01:22.578 --> 00:01:24.875
is looking at their existing audit reports.

00:01:24.875 --> 00:01:27.215
You'll find those at the bottom of this page.

00:01:27.215 --> 00:01:28.939
Let's look at the brave audit.

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.799
Brave is a web browser you can use that uses a currency named the basic attention token.

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:35.060
As you can see here,

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.215
this basic attention token was audited by Open Zeppelin.

00:01:38.215 --> 00:01:42.070
On this page, you'll see a list of the vulnerabilities that were found in the audit,

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:45.904
some tips for improving the code and a general overview of their findings.

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:49.790
You can read through this to get a better idea of how the auditing process works.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.040
You can also use this to find tips that you can

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.635
use to improve how you code your own contracts.

00:01:54.635 --> 00:01:57.260
For example, it shows here something as simple

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.055
as avoiding the use of var to define variables.

00:02:00.055 --> 00:02:02.900
Read through to understand the description of why and click

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.094
on the commit update to see how this was implemented in the code.

00:02:06.094 --> 00:02:09.859
Here, you can see the original uses of var on lines 81 and

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.885
85 as well as the updates to this code shown in green just like any other commit.

00:02:14.884 --> 00:02:18.379
When you get the chance, take some time to read through these audits.

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:21.979
I do suggest clicking through to see how the actual changes were implemented.

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:24.949
This will get you more familiar with how this process works.

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:27.469
For now, I just want to go over to other sites

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:29.960
that provide security audits for smart contracts.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.170
Like before, even if you don't want your contract audited yet,

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:36.349
they provide detailed audit reports you can use to learn from.

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.939
First, let's go to CoinFabrik.

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:43.069
The link below the video takes you straight to their smart contract audit report page.

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.935
Here, you'll see the audits they completed on Zeex,

00:02:45.935 --> 00:02:48.185
Stasis, Caspar and others.

00:02:48.185 --> 00:02:50.449
I don't know what all of these tools are quite yet,

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:51.679
but reading these posts,

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.000
you can learn more about them.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.985
For now, I'll check out the audit done on Casper.

00:02:55.985 --> 00:02:57.750
Just like on Open Zeppelin,

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:58.884
you'll find a summary,

00:02:58.884 --> 00:03:03.245
a list of vulnerabilities by severity and examples of the code there describing.

00:03:03.245 --> 00:03:07.099
I don't see links to the GitHub commits on this page like Open Zeppelin has,

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:11.064
Instead, they leave notes about updates that have been made to the contract.

00:03:11.064 --> 00:03:14.884
So, when you get the chance you can use this as another resource to help

00:03:14.884 --> 00:03:18.969
understand the audit and iteration process used for smart contracts.

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:22.340
Before wrapping up, there's one more sight I'd like to mention.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.254
Quillhash is another platform that provides audits for smart contracts.

00:03:26.254 --> 00:03:29.090
As you can see here, it's not the only service they provide.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.879
So, feel free to check out any of their other offerings.

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:34.469
For now, we'll stick with their auditing service.

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:37.879
To get there, scroll to the top of the page and click audits.

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:41.329
Scrolling down, I haven't found yet where they keep their audit reports,

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.080
but they do provide a link to something you might find interesting,

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.655
their Bug bounty program.

00:03:45.655 --> 00:03:48.140
Scrolling down, I haven't found yet where they keep

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:51.858
their audit reports but they do provide a link to something you might find interesting,

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:53.795
the ethereum bug bounty program.

00:03:53.794 --> 00:03:56.719
Bug bounty programs are something auditors will make use

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:59.750
of to get feedback from a community of expert reviewers.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:00.949
By clicking this link,

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:04.655
you'll see that the bug bounty program is available on the ethereum blog.

00:04:04.655 --> 00:04:08.705
This program allows anyone to submit vulnerabilities to earn points

00:04:08.705 --> 00:04:12.920
and is a great way to get involved with contributing to the security of smart contracts.

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.954
If you're interested, check out the rules,

00:04:14.955 --> 00:04:18.485
bounties and FAQ to get a better idea of how to get started.

00:04:18.485 --> 00:04:20.490
Similar to the auditing services,

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:22.819
there are many bug bounty programs that exist.

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:26.064
You can find more by searching around to find one that you like.

00:04:26.064 --> 00:04:28.694
By participating, you can learn valuable skills,

00:04:28.694 --> 00:04:32.974
get more involved in the community and even earn money with the skills you develop.

00:04:32.975 --> 00:04:36.560
All right. So, that wraps up this quick look at security audits.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.810
We went over a few different sites and I left you with

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.405
a lot of material you're hopefully excited to read through.

00:04:41.404 --> 00:04:43.504
Like other sections in this lesson,

00:04:43.504 --> 00:04:45.920
I wouldn't expect that you read all of this immediately.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.800
But if you'd like that's a great way to learn these new skills.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.770
Having these sites to reference is a great way to continue learning

00:04:51.769 --> 00:04:55.439
more about security and contract audits in the future.
