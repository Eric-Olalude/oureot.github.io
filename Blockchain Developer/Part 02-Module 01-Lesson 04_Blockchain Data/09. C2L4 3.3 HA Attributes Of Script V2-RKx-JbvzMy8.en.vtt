00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.780
Bitcoin Script is a simple stack-based language that offers a number of operations.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.310
It even has conditional flow control.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.234
However, there are intentional limitations

00:00:11.234 --> 00:00:14.259
built into it which we'll be covering in this section.

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:19.484
The goal of this concept is to familiarize you with the prominent attributes of Script.

00:00:19.484 --> 00:00:24.379
We'll be covering Turing Completeness and Stateless Verification.

00:00:24.379 --> 00:00:29.070
Now, one major attribute of Script is that it is not Turing Complete.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.710
This means there are no loops or complex flow controls,

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.910
other than conditional flow control.

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:37.689
This makes the language completely deterministic

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:40.604
so that we know when and how the program will end.

00:00:40.604 --> 00:00:44.199
Turing and Completeness removes the fear of being stuck in

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.695
an infinite loop which could block or crash the network.

00:00:47.695 --> 00:00:49.600
A limited language prevents

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.435
the transaction validation mechanism from being targeted and attacked as a vulnerability.

00:00:54.435 --> 00:00:59.045
Turing and completeness simplifies and secures the system.

00:00:59.045 --> 00:01:02.425
A second attribute of Script is that it is stateless.

00:01:02.424 --> 00:01:06.405
This means that all information needed to execute the Script is contained

00:01:06.405 --> 00:01:10.310
within the Script and no state is saved prior to running the Script,

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.495
or after the Script has ran.

00:01:12.495 --> 00:01:16.410
The benefit of a Stateless Verification is that the same

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.494
Script run anywhere in the system will execute the same way.

00:01:20.495 --> 00:01:23.734
So we can rest assured that a Script verified on our node,

00:01:23.734 --> 00:01:26.885
we verified the same way on another node.

00:01:26.885 --> 00:01:32.960
To recap, Bitcoin Script is not Turing complete and is stateless.

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:38.054
These two properties allow the network to better scale and build insecurity.

00:01:38.055 --> 00:01:40.425
As you learn more about other bloc chains,

00:01:40.424 --> 00:01:42.724
you'll encounter they've chosen to use languages

00:01:42.724 --> 00:01:45.604
with similar or vastly different properties.

00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:48.400
For example, instead of being stateless,

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.005
they may be stateful,

00:01:50.004 --> 00:01:54.734
meaning they do have an internal state that allows for loops and recursion.

00:01:54.734 --> 00:02:00.685
This allows for more flexibility but limits Scale for trustworthy verification.

00:02:00.685 --> 00:02:03.674
As you approach new blockchain platforms.

00:02:03.674 --> 00:02:09.009
be vigilant to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each implementation.
