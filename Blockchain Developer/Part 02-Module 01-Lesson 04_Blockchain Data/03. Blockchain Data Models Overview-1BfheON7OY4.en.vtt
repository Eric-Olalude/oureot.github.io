00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280
In order to understand how information is stored on any blockchain,

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.835
we need to understand block and transaction data models.

00:00:07.835 --> 00:00:09.810
This will help you build up and structure

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.425
your own private blockchain in the following project,

00:00:12.425 --> 00:00:16.850
as well as understand how to interact with existing information on blockchains.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.425
Earlier, we saw that blocks contain

00:00:19.425 --> 00:00:22.745
a block header with these important pieces of information,

00:00:22.745 --> 00:00:24.550
the Previous Block's Hash,

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.175
the Time the block was created,

00:00:26.175 --> 00:00:28.664
the Merkle Root and the Nonce.

00:00:28.664 --> 00:00:30.250
As we've explored before,

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.274
the body of the block contains transactions.

00:00:33.274 --> 00:00:35.199
In the next several sections,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:41.215
we'll expand on transaction data models focusing on transaction inputs and outputs,

00:00:41.215 --> 00:00:45.290
which will help us understand how to create our own raw transactions.

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:47.689
No matter which blockchain you end up working with,

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:51.949
it's important to remember that blockchains are a transactional system.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.030
Having a good grasp of this information is vital to understanding what's

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.960
going on under the hood with any blockchain service you end up working with.
