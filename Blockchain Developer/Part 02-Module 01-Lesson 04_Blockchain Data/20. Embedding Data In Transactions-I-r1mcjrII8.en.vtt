00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.179
Earlier we discussed that blockchain is a type of database;

00:00:04.179 --> 00:00:07.750
a database where there's no way to edit or delete information,

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.095
but we can read,

00:00:09.095 --> 00:00:11.265
append and validate data.

00:00:11.265 --> 00:00:13.030
This begs the question,

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:14.719
aside from transactional data,

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.410
can we add other types of data onto the blockchain?

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.214
If so, how is it done?

00:00:19.214 --> 00:00:22.640
Let's take a look at the Bitcoin blockchain as an example.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.620
Even though it is possible to store data on the Bitcoin blockchain,

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.929
the Bitcoin protocol was not designed for the purpose of data storage.

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.335
However, as the blockchain expands beyond finance,

00:00:34.335 --> 00:00:37.250
many companies and individuals started embedding data

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.810
with transactions in order to store non-financial data.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.289
Doing this, as you may have guessed,

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:45.530
comes with risks and issues.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.399
A number of other newer blockchain protocols have risen in order to fill this need.

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.039
Each hyper blockchain has its pros and cons as a data storage method including Bitcoin.

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.329
In this section, we'll discuss the best practices and

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.500
limitations of embedding data on the Bitcoin public blockchain.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.700
Understanding the risks here will help us be more aware of the pros and

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.530
cons when analyzing how other blockchains handle data storage.
