00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
Okay, fantastic. So now in this step,

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.310
I'm going to actually show you how to decode your transaction

00:00:05.309 --> 00:00:08.099
which means the transaction that we just created in the last step,

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.919
how to decode it and make sure that everything went fine.

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:15.570
Again, the command that we use for that is called decoderawtransaction,

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.120
followed by this hexstring that we just received back from creating the raw transaction.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.570
So I'm going to say, let's copy this hexstring.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.195
Then I'm going to have my command that says decoderawtransaction,

00:00:31.195 --> 00:00:34.605
and then I'm going to paste this,

00:00:34.604 --> 00:00:36.784
the complete string, fantastic.

00:00:36.784 --> 00:00:39.784
So this is how you can make sure that everything went fine.

00:00:39.784 --> 00:00:41.524
So again, if you see,

00:00:41.524 --> 00:00:43.174
this is the output that we got back.

00:00:43.174 --> 00:00:45.459
If you see there is one vin,

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.445
because we have one input.

00:00:47.445 --> 00:00:49.664
There's less one vin going in,

00:00:49.664 --> 00:00:51.375
and then this is this one,

00:00:51.375 --> 00:00:53.174
and then we have two vouts.

00:00:53.174 --> 00:00:57.644
So it's an array with one vout that we sent this much balance to,

00:00:57.645 --> 00:00:58.950
this much bitcoins to,

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.640
and then the other output that we sent this much bitcoins.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.200
If you remember the transaction that we did,

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.045
we had one input, two outputs.

00:01:05.045 --> 00:01:07.200
So this is how you know that everything went fine.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.140
Again, one thing I want you to look here is that if you look in the V input,

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.379
if you look in this V input over here,

00:01:13.379 --> 00:01:15.509
let's see, right there.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.040
If you look in this part,

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.510
you see that scriptSig,

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.564
which is the signature, is empty because we haven't signed our transaction yet.

00:01:22.564 --> 00:01:25.819
So the first thing that we definitely need to do before we send this transaction out,

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:30.419
we need to sign it first using our valid which I'm going to show you in the next step.
