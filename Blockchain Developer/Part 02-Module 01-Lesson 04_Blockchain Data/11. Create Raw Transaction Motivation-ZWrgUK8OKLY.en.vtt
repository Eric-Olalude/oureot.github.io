00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.870
Hi, everyone and we're back for Block Talk.

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.655
We're actually we are talking about raw transactions.

00:00:05.655 --> 00:00:09.750
So, as a reminder, raw transactions are how machines store off the transaction data.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.455
So, the lesson so far,

00:00:11.455 --> 00:00:14.949
we've taken a raw transaction and dissect it into its different parts,

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:17.890
and now you understand the components of a raw transaction.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.699
I want to ask you why is it important as

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.780
a Blockchain developer to know how raw transaction works?

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.815
Isn't a raw transaction meant for the computer?

00:00:26.815 --> 00:00:28.589
Yeah. It's absolutely meant for the computer.

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:31.129
I know we talked about before,

00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:33.424
we're trying to hit home on the protocol,

00:00:33.424 --> 00:00:35.769
and that's exactly what we're doing with the raw transaction.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.410
We're looking at the protocol,

00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:39.389
understand their roles on how to construct

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.399
a transaction that gets embedded into the Blockchain.

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:47.504
So, that life cycle of taking a transaction that's human readable,

00:00:47.505 --> 00:00:52.000
breaking it down to be consumable by like

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.079
the Bitcoin platform is extremely important in regards to the rules of the platform.

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.640
That's why we constantly are advocating about the protocol because those rules allow

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.715
us to have guidelines for the way that we're going to work with transactional data.

00:01:04.715 --> 00:01:07.650
We also understand the nuts and bolts will really help us down the line.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.910
Oh, absolutely.

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.019
Especially when it comes down to the way that we can

00:01:11.019 --> 00:01:14.045
work with transactional components of a Blockchain.

00:01:14.045 --> 00:01:17.170
It's even better to understand that the same principles

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.314
with a raw transaction also works on other platforms.

00:01:20.314 --> 00:01:23.709
So, the way that you broke down the transaction as

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:28.299
a raw transaction is literally the same way that you would use it on another platform.

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:30.899
You still need to go ahead and transact,

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.594
especially when we migrate to back-end services.

00:01:33.594 --> 00:01:37.700
How does the network communicate with transactional data?

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.745
It's all about raw transactions.

00:01:39.745 --> 00:01:41.785
Yeah. It's a really powerful way to think about it.

00:01:41.784 --> 00:01:45.799
So, with that, let's start creating our own raw transaction.
