00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.450
Awesome. So now, we have successfully sent a transaction

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.030
into the network to be added to the blockchain.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.789
In this step, I'm going to show you how to make sure that everything

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:12.254
went fine with the transaction that we just sent as a sent out.

00:00:12.255 --> 00:00:14.400
For this, you can actually use the command called

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.875
gettransaction followed by the transaction hash.

00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:20.745
So this is the transaction hash that we just got and in our last step.

00:00:20.745 --> 00:00:24.460
So let me go copy this transaction hash.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.230
So if you see that's on the screen, but I'm going to do it again.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.894
So that's the command gettransaction,

00:00:29.894 --> 00:00:31.289
and let's do it again.

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.954
Gettransaction, and then you have your transaction hash followed by it.

00:00:35.954 --> 00:00:38.335
So it gives you a complete information of the transaction.

00:00:38.335 --> 00:00:41.390
So this shows you that everything went fine.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.240
So let me quickly walk you through some of these numbers.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.469
The amount is a positive number of Bitcoins if this transaction increased,

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:49.909
the total wallet balance.

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:53.119
A negative number of Bitcoins if this transaction decreased,

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:54.199
the total wallet balance,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.545
or zero if the transaction had no effect on the wallet balance.

00:00:57.545 --> 00:00:59.810
In our case, since I'm just transferring from

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.810
one address to another address within my same wallet,

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:03.830
just as an exercise,

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.454
I'm not giving out any Bitcoins in external address.

00:01:06.454 --> 00:01:08.750
So that's the reason you see my amount to be zero because

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.064
the overall net effect on a wallet balance is nothing.

00:01:12.064 --> 00:01:17.224
Fee, of course is the fee paid by the transaction reported as negative Bitcoins.

00:01:17.224 --> 00:01:19.219
Confirmations, we just did it.

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:20.870
Of course, there is no confirmations yet,

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.545
the number of Bitcoin confirmations that the transaction has received.

00:01:24.545 --> 00:01:26.629
Of course, you saw information.

00:01:26.629 --> 00:01:27.814
The main one again as an X1,

00:01:27.814 --> 00:01:29.539
is a transaction hash.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.740
This is the all the ID,

00:01:30.739 --> 00:01:33.289
but it is a transaction ID for this transaction.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.000
You also might see a block hash,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.599
a block index, or block time.

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:37.649
That's a hash of the block,

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.805
or the index of the block,

00:01:38.805 --> 00:01:40.020
or the time of the block.

00:01:40.019 --> 00:01:42.170
Again, the reason we're not seeing any of those

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.659
because there is only return for conformed transactions.

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.819
So if you see a block hash, block index,

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:50.389
or block time, there is only returned for transaction that are confirmed.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.609
Since we're not confirmed yet, so we don't see that.

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:54.858
But if you do it in a while and you see some confirmations,

00:01:54.858 --> 00:01:56.599
you'll also see block hash,

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:58.284
block index, and block time.

00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:02.045
Account or the address

00:02:02.045 --> 00:02:05.829
is the address to which the payment was credited to or debited from.

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:08.754
It maybe an empty screen for the default account.

00:02:08.754 --> 00:02:12.530
A category, it could be send or receive based

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.594
upon if you're sending a payment or if you're receiving a payment.

00:02:16.594 --> 00:02:18.965
Then you can also see vout number.

00:02:18.965 --> 00:02:20.390
For an output transaction,

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:23.619
this would be the output index for this output in this transaction.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.259
For an input transaction,

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:27.530
this will be the output index for the output that is

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.775
being spent in this transaction. Got it?

00:02:29.775 --> 00:02:33.115
Because we use an UT axial in that input transaction,

00:02:33.115 --> 00:02:34.640
it would be that number.

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:37.069
So those are some of the numbers I wanted you to look at,

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.340
but just look at this screen again and you're really going to get comfortable

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.920
with all of these fields and the fantastic grades.

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:46.444
So now you have learned how to create a raw transaction,

00:02:46.444 --> 00:02:48.590
sign it, and then send it to the network.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.645
To summarize, we used a UT axial from an existing transaction as the input.

00:02:53.645 --> 00:02:57.659
Then we sign a transaction and then be send it to the network.
