00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
Okay. So the first thing that we want to do is to find out what UTXOs do we have in

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.219
our wallet so we can use an available UTXO as an input to create an output transaction.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.109
Remember, Bitcoin transaction inputs come from the output of a previous transaction.

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.750
During the transaction, these funds are transferred from one address to another address.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.730
Now let's go to a deeper console.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.545
For that you're going to go to Help,

00:00:24.545 --> 00:00:27.685
Debug window and Debug console.

00:00:27.684 --> 00:00:29.199
So I'm going to show you,

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.655
let me make the screen a little bit bigger here.

00:00:31.655 --> 00:00:37.355
So I'll do this command again and the way you check what all UTXOs was irreadable,

00:00:37.354 --> 00:00:39.859
you will type the command 'listunspent'.

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:41.329
When you type a command,

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.784
listunspent, you will see an array.

00:00:44.784 --> 00:00:47.929
Now, these can be used as inputs in other transactions.

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:50.710
As you see the result is a list of unspent outputs.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.634
It is an array of objects each describing an unspent output.

00:00:54.634 --> 00:00:58.265
It can be empty if you don't have any unspent outputs in your wallet.

00:00:58.265 --> 00:01:00.710
Let me quickly walk you through all these fields.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.079
So we'll start with this one here the txid.

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:04.459
Let's just pick one example here.

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:06.864
So it's an array of all UTXOs available.

00:01:06.864 --> 00:01:09.159
So if you see the txid,

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:11.734
which is a transaction ID for this transaction.

00:01:11.734 --> 00:01:16.364
The vout is the output index of the output within this transaction.

00:01:16.364 --> 00:01:18.879
So it could be zero or one in some cases,

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:23.089
depends upon how many outputs or UTXOs were created in this transaction.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.865
So if a transaction created two outputs,

00:01:25.864 --> 00:01:28.644
then we're going to have an array with zero and one.

00:01:28.644 --> 00:01:32.390
Address, this is the address to which the output is paid.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.875
Label; in case you gave a label to the transaction, it's going to show up here.

00:01:36.875 --> 00:01:41.180
Redeemscript, a script that is similar in function like the PubKey script.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.430
One copy if it is hashed to create

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.090
the PubKey script and the other copies placed on the signature script.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.990
Of course it's a little bit complicated but you really do not need this for now.

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:52.414
It's not that information important.

00:01:52.415 --> 00:01:55.415
But again if you want to, you can always look it up for more information.

00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:57.365
Then we have the scriptPubKey.

00:01:57.364 --> 00:02:00.199
This is the hash of the locking script that we talked about in

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.890
the previous lessons and it's also called the PubKey script.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.540
Then we have the amount.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.210
This is the amount that is paid to the address in Bitcoins.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.070
Conformations, the number of

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.014
confirmations that have been received for this transaction so far.

00:02:15.014 --> 00:02:18.019
Spendable, now this is set to true if

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.064
the private key or the keys needed to spend this output are part of the wallet.

00:02:22.064 --> 00:02:24.275
So in my case it's true.

00:02:24.275 --> 00:02:28.250
Then we have another flag that says solvable.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.465
This is set to true if the wallet knows how to spend this output.

00:02:31.465 --> 00:02:35.210
It is set to false if the wallet does not know how to spend the output.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.775
It is ignored if the private keys are available.

00:02:37.775 --> 00:02:41.590
So now we know what UTXOs are available.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.240
In the next step I'm going to show you how we can actually

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.740
use one of these UTXOs and create a rod transaction
