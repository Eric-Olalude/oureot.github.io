00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.530
Let's talk about how we can control smart contract operations.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.699
We'll start off with a simple warm-up lesson in code, momentarily.

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:11.189
What that will help us do is ensure that

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:13.994
your development environment is set up correctly.

00:00:13.994 --> 00:00:15.929
What we will cover in there,

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.309
is the ability to pause your smart contract if it has a problem.

00:00:20.309 --> 00:00:25.349
This particular feature will be the building block for the next part of the lesson,

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.730
which is multi-party consensus.
