00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
Let's talk a little bit about the specific skills you'll be

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.535
getting before we start our session for today.

00:00:08.535 --> 00:00:15.344
We want to first focus on improving your ability to develop decentralized applications.

00:00:15.345 --> 00:00:19.155
While developing client-server applications has a certain set of skills,

00:00:19.155 --> 00:00:23.100
decentralized applications also require a certain set of skills,

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.520
and that's what the focus of this course is going to be.

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.250
We also want you to be able to know how to mitigate

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.384
problems if they come up in the course of developing,

00:00:32.384 --> 00:00:35.890
or even executing your smart contract.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.710
Finally, we want you to be able to easily integrate

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.395
third party or third world sources into your smart contract,

00:00:45.395 --> 00:00:48.750
and also architected for code immutability.
