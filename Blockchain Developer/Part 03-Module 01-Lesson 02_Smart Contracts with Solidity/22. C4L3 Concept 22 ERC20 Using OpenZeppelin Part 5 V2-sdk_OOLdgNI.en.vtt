00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.069
Okay. Fantastic. So now,

00:00:02.069 --> 00:00:05.804
we have made sure that we have enough Ether in our Rinkeby address

00:00:05.804 --> 00:00:09.629
by asking it from one of the public faucets,

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.250
and once we have everything set off,

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.259
we are absolutely ready to deploy our token or a token contracts to the Rinkeby network.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.075
The way you do that is you do truffle, migrate.

00:00:21.074 --> 00:00:25.439
I'm going to give a reset flag because I've deployed it already.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.960
You do not have to do it if it's the first time.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.350
Then, network, and then I'm going say Rinkeby.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.840
So again, these are two hyphen reset and again hyphen, hyphen,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.960
network and then Rinkeby, and hit Enter.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.490
Now, this probably takes maybe a little bit less than a minute.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.775
So, we're just going to sit and wait for this to go through,

00:00:43.774 --> 00:00:45.094
and then soon enough,

00:00:45.094 --> 00:00:48.119
we will have our address back.

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:51.750
This is the address of where the contract is deployed.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.730
Okay. We are back now and then we have our contract deployed and if you see,

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:59.750
we get an address back.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:00.979
So, this is the token address,

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:02.869
the name of the token was sampleToken,

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:07.189
that we picked, and then this is the address that we just deployed our contract to.

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:09.379
So, I'm going to copy this address and let me show you

00:01:09.379 --> 00:01:12.719
how we can actually find it on Etherscan.

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:15.629
So, let's go to our Etherscan.

00:01:15.629 --> 00:01:17.579
So, now let's go to Etherscan window.

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:22.094
I'm in rinkeby.etherscan.io, and I'm just zooming it for you all,

00:01:22.094 --> 00:01:24.780
and I'm going to paste my token address.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.344
The deployed address right there and I'm going to hit Enter.

00:01:28.344 --> 00:01:34.780
Once I see that, you see I see this contract came with the hash deployed from my address.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.820
If you see this is my metamask address, and this is,

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:41.759
just came in 53 seconds back in then it's all there.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.170
Okay. So, fantastic.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.850
So, now we can actually see, we can actually find our token and

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:48.924
our token contract on one of the public Etherscan sites.

00:01:48.924 --> 00:01:51.519
Now, the way you transfer tokens from one address to

00:01:51.519 --> 00:01:53.229
another address is you want to first of all

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.579
make sure that you add it to your own account.

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.914
So, we're going go to our metamask, right there,

00:01:58.915 --> 00:02:01.295
and I'm going to go click on the side,

00:02:01.295 --> 00:02:03.605
and I'm going to say Add Token.

00:02:03.605 --> 00:02:05.630
I'm going to hit on Custom token.

00:02:05.629 --> 00:02:07.969
I'm going to paste the token address that we got back.

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:08.990
See? If you see,

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.600
it automatically picks the symbol that we just

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.299
chose and if you see the balance is perfect.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.890
This is the balance we chose, right?

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:18.094
Now, I'm going to say Add Tokens.

00:02:18.094 --> 00:02:22.210
Fantastic. So, now, this token is added to my account.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:23.770
So, now, I own these tokens.

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.560
Now, I can send this token to any other address and the way I do that,

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.780
let's go, if you don't have more accounts,

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.939
you can always create accounts. So, click here.

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:34.814
You can create a new account, if you want more accounts.

00:02:34.814 --> 00:02:37.020
I do have accounts. I'm going to go on account two.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.640
I'm going to copy this address.

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:40.579
So, what I'm doing is that I'm actually transferring

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.025
some tokens from one account to another account.

00:02:43.025 --> 00:02:45.300
So, this is my account.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.740
I'm going to say, copy this address.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.110
I'm going to go back in my account one,

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.665
and I'm going to now transfer tokens. The way you do that?

00:02:52.664 --> 00:02:54.269
You click on your tokens,

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.235
and then you say you want to send it,

00:02:56.235 --> 00:02:58.860
and then I am already the one that's sending

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.445
it account one and I'm sending it to account two.

00:03:01.444 --> 00:03:04.384
You can just pick it down from down here too or just paste it,

00:03:04.384 --> 00:03:05.929
and now I want to say, let's say,

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.520
you just want to give 10 tokens away.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.765
Okay, and then hit Next.

00:03:10.764 --> 00:03:12.899
It's going to confirm the gas fee,

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.594
so hit on Confirm,

00:03:14.594 --> 00:03:18.784
and just takes about maybe 20-30 seconds for this to go through,

00:03:18.784 --> 00:03:20.900
and if you say it says pending for now,

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.270
and soon enough it's going to accept it and this is

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.705
exactly how you see it says confirmed transaction,

00:03:26.705 --> 00:03:30.270
and so now, this account has 10 tokens because I need a phase.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.975
If you see my balance went down by 10 tokens,

00:03:32.974 --> 00:03:39.370
and if I go click on our account two.

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.110
Now, the way you would see that in this account,

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.120
you again, need to add the tokens to that, right?

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.575
So, go add that token,

00:03:45.574 --> 00:03:47.344
with again, that token address.

00:03:47.344 --> 00:03:49.430
In fact, we need that token address back.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.909
So, let's go back to my window and pick the token address.

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:55.870
In fact, we can also get it from a terminal window.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.085
So, this was the address.

00:03:59.085 --> 00:04:01.379
Okay. Fantastic. So, now,

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.525
we have that, we have the token address.

00:04:03.525 --> 00:04:04.890
Go to account two,

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:06.689
and I'm going to add a custom token.

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:09.490
This one and see it picks up the symbol again,

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.210
and if you see this has a balance of 10.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.750
Fantastic. So, now this account has 10 tokens and

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.475
my account one has these many tokens because I sent away some tokens.

00:04:19.475 --> 00:04:22.040
Fantastic. So, this is a fantastic week,

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.020
and send tokens to your friends, and,

00:04:24.019 --> 00:04:27.199
now this is the exact same way that you would also use for any Mainnet or

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:30.740
just using Rinkeby but remember Mainnet just uses main Ether,

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.259
which is main money or real money.

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:38.079
So, this is just the way you would transfer from any address to another address.

00:04:38.079 --> 00:04:39.589
It could be a Rinkeby address,

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:43.435
it could be a Coven address or it could be any of the Mainnet addresses too.

00:04:43.435 --> 00:04:47.269
So, this is a fantastic project that we did to transfer tokens,

00:04:47.269 --> 00:04:49.159
create your own tokens and also be able to

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.930
transfer tokens from one address to another address.
