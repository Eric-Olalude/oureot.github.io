00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.794
Okay. So, now we are all set to deploy our token,

00:00:03.794 --> 00:00:06.435
our token contract to a public network, Rinkeby.

00:00:06.434 --> 00:00:07.949
Now, the first thing I'm going to show you,

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.339
you definitely want to make sure that you have enough ether in your balance.

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:13.710
The way you can check that, is using your MetaMask.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.039
So, going to click on this ''MetaMask" icon on the side.

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.929
If you have the right network,

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:21.585
so we're going to start deploying this on Rinkeby.

00:00:21.585 --> 00:00:23.295
If I click on "Rinkeby",

00:00:23.295 --> 00:00:25.350
and you see you have two accounts,

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.875
and one of them has enough balance and the other one of course zero balance.

00:00:28.875 --> 00:00:31.440
So, I'm going to make sure that this account is selected.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.390
If this account is not selected,

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.890
and if I select this account,

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.170
and I start deploying my contract,

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.960
it's going to not go through just because I do not have enough balance.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.179
You want to make sure that this account is selected.

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:43.750
If you don't have enough balance,

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.835
you can always go to any of the public faucets.

00:00:46.835 --> 00:00:50.030
All you can do, you

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.120
can actually infer the very first one that pulls up right there, is this one.

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:54.799
If you don't see that, that's fine.

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:56.734
Just go, type rinkebyetherfaucet,

00:00:56.734 --> 00:00:59.195
and you will find quite a bit.

00:00:59.195 --> 00:01:01.899
So, the first one I'm going to go click on.

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:08.579
All you're going to do, is that it really wants you to post an address of a URL.

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:11.024
The way it goes is that, if you go to Google Plus,

00:01:11.025 --> 00:01:13.215
and you take your MetaMask account,

00:01:13.215 --> 00:01:14.865
and then you just have opposed.

00:01:14.864 --> 00:01:16.269
All you do is a public post,

00:01:16.269 --> 00:01:20.075
and you bring that address of the URL that you posted and paste it right there,

00:01:20.075 --> 00:01:21.500
and then he can request ether.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.939
So, what I'm going to do,

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:24.969
is go to my MetaMask.

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:26.849
Once I go to my MetaMask,

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:29.714
I'm going to go to "My Accounts" and I'm going to copy this.

00:01:29.715 --> 00:01:35.745
Okay? So, I copied my address and I'm going to go to plus.google.com.

00:01:35.745 --> 00:01:41.925
Once I go there, I'm going to go paste my account address right there.

00:01:41.924 --> 00:01:47.009
Once I've pasted, it's going to give me a URL box.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.410
I'm going to take this URL now,

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.890
and then go paste this URL right there.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.510
I'm going to say, "Give me these many ethers," you have some options.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:57.965
So, I'm going to choose this option,

00:01:57.965 --> 00:02:01.469
and then I'm going to say, "Give me Ether".

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.724
So, if you see its funding right now,

00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:06.314
and it probably just will gives you.

00:02:06.314 --> 00:02:07.629
There's some limited options,

00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:09.710
you can choose three ethers and for eight hours,

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.060
or three options here.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.000
So, it's going to go through and let's give it just about another couple of seconds,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.469
and then it's going to go through and give me confirmation back.

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:24.050
You'll see my balance in my MetaMask should also go up with the same time.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.960
So, let's go click on our "MetaMask balance".

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.280
So, if you see it went,

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.599
in fact, just went double.

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.729
I had 3,000 something, though it's quite a bit more.

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:33.479
Now, these are just play tokens,

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:35.429
I mean they don't really have value.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.860
But again, really helps you to test and work around the test networks.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.080
Fantastic. So, we're all set.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.685
Now, we have this much balance.

00:02:43.685 --> 00:02:46.699
So now, we are ready to deploy it to a public network,

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:49.669
which I will show you in the next video on Rinkeby.
