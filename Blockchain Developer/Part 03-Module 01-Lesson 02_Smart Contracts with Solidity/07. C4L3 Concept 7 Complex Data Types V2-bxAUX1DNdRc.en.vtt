00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
In this concept, we will talk about various complex data types available in Solidity.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.855
So, the various types that we have are; arrays,

00:00:09.855 --> 00:00:15.975
structs, mapping, strings, bytes and enums.

00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:21.660
Now, complex data types are managed quite differently in memory than basic datatypes.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.524
Complex data types also need memory allocation to persist and recall execution.

00:00:27.524 --> 00:00:29.909
I'm going to explain you all these concepts in

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.295
detail as we talk about the different types.

00:00:32.295 --> 00:00:34.320
Starting from the next concept,

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.869
I will explain you this complex types one by one.
